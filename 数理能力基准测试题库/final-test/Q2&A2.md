## Abstract

This document provides a rigorous proof of the classification theorem for the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the exceptional complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$. It is a common misconception that $\mathfrak{g}_2$ possesses only two such representations. The correct statement, which we will prove, is that the isomorphism classes of these representations are in a one-to-one correspondence with the set of dominant integral weights. These weights form a lattice generated by two fundamental weights, which correspond to the well-known 7-dimensional (standard) and 14-dimensional (adjoint) representations.

## 1 The Structure of the Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$

To understand the representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$, we must first understand its structure. Let $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g}_2$ be the 14-dimensional exceptional complex simple Lie algebra of rank 2.

Definition 1.1 (Cartan Subalgebra and Root System). Let $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ be a Cartan subalgebra (a maximal abelian subalgebra of semisimple elements). For $\mathfrak{g}_2$, $\text{dim}(\mathfrak{h}) = 2$. For any non-zero linear functional $\alpha \in \mathfrak{h}^*$, we define the **root space**
$$
\mathfrak{g}_\alpha = \{X \in \mathfrak{g} \mid [H, X] = \alpha(H)X \text{ for all } H \in \mathfrak{h}\}.
$$
If $\mathfrak{g}_\alpha \neq \{0\}$, $\alpha$ is called a **root**. The set of all roots, denoted $\Delta$, forms the **root system** of $\mathfrak{g}$. The algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ decomposes as
$$
\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Delta} \mathfrak{g}_\alpha.
$$
For $\mathfrak{g}_2$, the root system $\Delta$ consists of 12 roots. We can choose a basis of $\Delta$ consisting of two **simple roots**, $\alpha_1$ (short) and $\alpha_2$ (long). Let $(\cdot, \cdot)$ denote the inner product on $\mathfrak{h}^*$ induced by the Killing form. We normalize it such that $(\alpha_2, \alpha_2) = 2$. The geometry of the root system then implies:
$$
(\alpha_1, \alpha_1) = \frac{2}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad (\alpha_1, \alpha_2) = -1.
$$
Definition 1.2 (Cartan Matrix). The Cartan matrix $A = (A_{ij})$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by $A_{ij} = \frac{2(\alpha_i, \alpha_j)}{(\alpha_j, \alpha_j)}$. For $\mathfrak{g}_2$, this gives:
$$
A_{11} = \frac{2(\alpha_1, \alpha_1)}{(\alpha_1, \alpha_1)} = 2
$$
$$
A_{12} = \frac{2(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)}{(\alpha_2, \alpha_2)} = \frac{2(-1)}{2} = -1
$$
$$
A_{21} = \frac{2(\alpha_2, \alpha_1)}{(\alpha_1, \alpha_1)} = \frac{2(-1)}{2/3} = -3
$$
$$
A_{22} = \frac{2(\alpha_2, \alpha_2)}{(\alpha_2, \alpha_2)} = 2
$$
Thus, the Cartan matrix for $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is
$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ -3 & 2 \end{pmatrix}.
$$

## 2 The Theorem of the Highest Weight

The classification of irreducible representations relies on the concept of weights.

Definition 2.1 (Weights of a Representation). Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional representation of $\mathfrak{g}$. A linear functional $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ is a **weight** of $V$ if the **weight space**
$$
V_\lambda = \{v \in V \mid H \cdot v = \lambda(H)v \text{ for all } H \in \mathfrak{h}\}
$$
is non-zero. Any finite-dimensional representation $V$ admits a weight space decomposition: $V = \bigoplus_{\lambda} V_\lambda$.

Definition 2.2 (Highest Weight). Let $\Delta^+$ be the set of positive roots (those that are non-negative linear combinations of the simple roots $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$). A weight $\lambda$ of a representation $V$ is called a **highest weight** if $\lambda + \alpha$ is not a weight for any $\alpha \in \Delta^+$.

The central pillar of the theory is the following lemma, stated here without its full proof.

Lemma 2.3. Every finite-dimensional irreducible representation $V$ of a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ has a unique highest weight $\lambda$. The weight space $V_\lambda$ is one-dimensional.

The properties of this unique highest weight are what allow for the classification.

Definition 2.4 (Dominant Integral Weights). An element $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ is called an **integral weight** if it satisfies
$$
\frac{2(\lambda, \alpha_i)}{(\alpha_i, \alpha_i)} \in \mathbb{Z} \quad \text{for all simple roots } \alpha_i.
$$
An integral weight $\lambda$ is called **dominant** if it further satisfies
$$
\frac{2(\lambda, \alpha_i)}{(\alpha_i, \alpha_i)} \geq 0 \quad \text{for all simple roots } \alpha_i.
$$
The set of all dominant integral weights is denoted by $\Lambda^+$.

Definition 2.5 (Fundamental Weights). The **fundamental weights** $\{\omega_1, \omega_2\}$ form a basis for the weight lattice dual to the simple roots. They are defined by the relation:
$$
\frac{2(\omega_i, \alpha_j)}{(\alpha_j, \alpha_j)} = \delta_{ij} \quad \text{for } i, j \in \{1, 2\}.
$$

Proposition 2.6. The set of dominant integral weights $\Lambda^+$ for $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is precisely the set of all non-negative integer linear combinations of its fundamental weights.

Proof. Let $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ be an arbitrary weight. We can write it in the basis of fundamental weights: $\lambda = a_1\omega_1 + a_2\omega_2$ for some coefficients $a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}$. Now, let's check the condition for $\lambda$ to be a dominant integral weight:
$$
\frac{2(\lambda, \alpha_j)}{(\alpha_j, \alpha_j)} = \frac{2(a_1\omega_1 + a_2\omega_2, \alpha_j)}{(\alpha_j, \alpha_j)} = a_1 \frac{2(\omega_1, \alpha_j)}{(\alpha_j, \alpha_j)} + a_2 \frac{2(\omega_2, \alpha_j)}{(\alpha_j, \alpha_j)}.
$$
Using the defining property of fundamental weights, this simplifies to:
$$
\frac{2(\lambda, \alpha_j)}{(\alpha_j, \alpha_j)} = a_1\delta_{1j} + a_2\delta_{2j}.
$$
For $j=1$, the condition is $a_1 \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. For $j=2$, the condition is $a_2 \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. Therefore, $\lambda$ is a dominant integral weight if and only if it can be written as $\lambda = a_1\omega_1 + a_2\omega_2$ with $a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. $\square$

### 3 The Main Classification Theorem for $\mathfrak{g}_2$

We now arrive at the main theorem.

Theorem 3.1 (Classification Theorem for $\mathfrak{g}_2$). There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ and the set of dominant integral weights $\Lambda^+$.
$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{c} \text{Isomorphism classes of finite-dim.} \\ \text{irreducible representations of } \mathfrak{g}_2 \end{array} \right\} \longleftrightarrow \Lambda^+ = \{a_1\omega_1 + a_2\omega_2 \mid a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\}
$$
For each $\lambda \in \Lambda^+$, we denote the corresponding irreducible representation by $L(\lambda)$.

Proof Outline. The proof consists of three main parts, established in the general theory of semisimple Lie algebras:

1. **Uniqueness**: If $V$ is a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{g}_2$, its highest weight $\lambda$ must be a dominant integral weight. This is a standard result derived from analyzing the action of the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-subalgebras associated with each simple root on the weight strings in $V$. Furthermore, if two irreducible representations have the same highest weight, they are isomorphic. This establishes an injective map from the set of representations to $\Lambda^+$.

2. **Existence**: For every dominant integral weight $\lambda \in \Lambda^+$, one must construct an irreducible representation $L(\lambda)$ with $\lambda$ as its highest weight. This is the most technical part of the theory. The standard construction involves Verma modules. For any $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$, one constructs an infinite-dimensional representation $M(\lambda)$, the Verma module, which is universal in a certain sense. It is then shown that $M(\lambda)$ contains a unique maximal proper submodule $N(\lambda)$. The quotient $L(\lambda) = M(\lambda)/N(\lambda)$ is irreducible with highest weight $\lambda$. A crucial theorem by Weyl and Harish-Chandra states that $L(\lambda)$ is finite-dimensional if and only if $\lambda$ is a dominant integral weight.

3. **Conclusion**: Part 1 shows the map from representations to $\Lambda^+$ is well-defined and injective. Part 2 shows this map is surjective. Therefore, the map is a bijection, establishing the theorem. Every finite-dimensional irreducible representation is uniquely labeled, up to isomorphism, by a pair of non-negative integers $(a_1, a_2)$, which are the coefficients of its highest weight in the basis of fundamental weights. $\square$

### 4 The Fundamental Representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$

The theorem shows that there are infinitely many irreducible representations, corresponding to all pairs $(a_1, a_2) \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} \times \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. The two representations constructed in the prompt are special because they are the building blocks of this classification system. They correspond to the basis vectors of the cone of dominant integral weights.

* **The Representation $L(\omega_1)$**: This corresponds to the highest weight $\lambda = \omega_1$, or the pair $(1, 0)$. This is the **7-dimensional standard representation**, which can be constructed from the action of $\mathfrak{g}_2 = \text{Der}(\mathbb{O})$ (the derivation algebra of the octonions) on the 7-dimensional space of imaginary octonions.

* **The Representation $L(\omega_2)$**: This corresponds to the highest weight $\lambda = \omega_2$, or the pair $(0, 1)$. This is the **14-dimensional adjoint representation**, where the representation space is $\mathfrak{g}_2$ itself, and the action is given by the Lie bracket, $\rho(X)(Y) = [X, Y]$. The highest weight of the adjoint representation is always the highest root of the Lie algebra, which for $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is $3\alpha_1 + 2\alpha_2 = \omega_2$.

Remark 4.1. All other irreducible representations, such as $L(2\omega_1)$ or $L(\omega_1 + \omega_2)$, can be found as irreducible components within the tensor products of these two fundamental representations.

For instance, $L(2\omega_1)$ appears as a subrepresentation of $L(\omega_1) \otimes L(\omega_1)$. This confirms that while there are infinitely many irreducible representations, they are all generated from a finite set of fundamental ones.
