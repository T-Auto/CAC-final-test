The user asks a riddle in Chinese: "左手一只鸭，右手一只鸡。交换两次双手物品后，左右手中各是啥？" Means: In left hand there is a duck, in right hand there is a chicken. After swapping the items in both hands twice, what are each in left and right hands?

Interpretation: Starting with left hand: duck, right hand: chicken. Then swap the items between the hands twice. So first swap: left gets chicken, right gets duck. Second swap: left gets duck, right gets chicken. So after two swaps, left hand returns to duck, right hand to chicken. But maybe they ask "交换两次双手物品后" could mean "exchange the items between the two hands twice", i.e., each exchange swaps them. So after two swaps, they are back to original.

Thus answer: left hand has duck, right hand has chicken.

But maybe there is twist: The phrase "交换两次双手物品" could also be interpreted as swapping items twice, meaning you do two separate swaps: first swap left and right, then swap again. So final is original.

Thus answer: left hand has a duck, right hand has a chicken.

Thus respond in Chinese: "左手里仍是鸭，右手里仍是鸡" with explanation.

Thus answer.

But maybe there's trick: The phrase "交换两次双手物品" could also mean you exchange the items in the left hand twice (swap left's duck with something else?) Not clear. Let's parse Chinese carefully.

"左手一只鸭，右手一只鸡。交换两次双手物品后，左右手中各是啥？"

literal: "Left hand has a duck, right hand has a chicken. After swapping the items in both hands twice, what are in each hand?" So it's definitely about swapping left and right twice.

Thus answer: left hand: duck, right hand: chicken.

Thus respond.

But maybe the answer expects "左手的鸭，右手的鸡" as the answer. Provide explanation.

Thus final answer: 左手中是鸭，右手中是鸡.

Will also explain reasoning.

Thus answer.

Now produce final.

**答案：左手里仍是鸭，右手里仍是鸡。**

**推理过程：**

1. 初始状态：  
   - 左手 → 鸭  
   - 右手 → 鸡  

2. 第一次交换（把左手的鸭和右手的鸡互换）：  
   - 左手 → 鸡  
   - 右手 → 鸭  

3. 第二次交换（再次把左手的鸡和右手的鸭互换）：  
   - 左手 → 鸭  
   - 右手 → 鸡  

两次交换后，两只手的物品又回到了最初的状态，所以最终仍然是：

- **左手中是鸭**  
- **右手中是鸡**  

这其实是“交换两次等于不变”的常见数学（群论）现象：一次交换是“翻转”，两次翻转又恢复原样。
