We need to respond in Chinese (user wrote Chinese). The user asks: "九点一一 和 九点八 , who is bigger?" This means "9.11 and 9.8, which is larger?" They likely refer to decimal numbers. 9.11 > 9.8, because 9.11 is 9.110 and 9.8 is 9.800. So 9.11 is bigger. But note that 9.11 is a decimal: nine point one one. 9.8 is nine point eight. In typical decimal comparisons, 9.8 < 9.11? Wait check: 9.8 = 9.80, 9.11 = 9.11. Since 0.11 < 0.80, 9.11 < 9.8. Actually hold on: The integer part is 9 for both. Compare fractional part: 0.11 vs 0.8. 0.8 = 0.80. So 0.11 < 0.80. So 9.11 < 9.8. So 9.8 is bigger. Right. I misread earlier: 9.11 is smaller because .11 < .8. So 9.8 is larger. However, sometimes confusion arises: People think 9.11 > 9.8 because 11 > 8, but forgetting decimal places. So the answer: 9.8 is bigger.

Thus respond: 9.8 is bigger; the difference is 0.31? Wait compute: 9.8 - 9.11 = 0.69? Let's compute: 9.8 = 9.80. 9.80 - 9.11 = 0.69. Yes. So 9.8 is larger by 0.69.

Thus respond in Chinese: 9.8 更大，差值为 0.69。

We can elaborate explanation.

Also mention that if they meant time or other context? They wrote "九点一一 和 九点八". In Chinese, "九点一一" might refer to time 9:11, "九点八" could be 9:08? Or "九点八" might be 9.8 decimal? Usually "九点八" could be time: 9:08. "九点一一" could be 9:11. In time, 9:11 is later than 9:08, so 9:11 > 9:08. So ambiguous. The question: "九点一一 和 九点八 , who is bigger?" It likely refers to numeric values 9.11 and 9.8. But could be times. We can address both contexts: If they are times, 9:11 is larger; if they are decimal numbers, 9.8 is larger. Let's see typical usage: In Chinese, they might say "九点一一" meaning 9:11 (like 9:11). "九点八" could be "九点八" for decimal? Usually "九点八" is ambiguous: Could be "9.8" as a decimal, or could be "9点8分" meaning 9:08 (but they'd usually say "九点零八分"). So "九点八" is more likely a decimal. However, "九点一一" is a phrase that is not typical for decimal, they'd say "九点一一" meaning 9.11 decimal? They might say "九点一一" indeed like "9.11" if they talk about scores, like "九点一一分"? But they'd more commonly say "九点一一分". Actually, Chinese decimal numbers are expressed as "点" after the integer part: e.g., "三点五" = 3.5. So "九点一一" is 9.11. So both are decimal numbers. So answer: 9.8 is larger. If they are times, they'd say "九点一一分" and "九点八分". But they'd likely be numeric. So answer: 9.8 is bigger.

Thus respond: 9.8 更大 (比 9.11 大 0.69). Provide explanation.

Add note: If context is time, then 9:11 > 9:08.

Thus answer in Chinese.

**答案：** **九点八**（9.8）更大。

**比较过程**  
- 九点一一 = 9.11  
- 九点八 = 9.80  

两者整数部分相同，都是 9。比较小数部分：  
- 9.11 的小数部分是 0.11  
- 9.80 的小数部分是 0.80  

因为 0.80 > 0.11，所以 9.80（即 9.8）大于 9.11。两者相差：

\[
9.80 - 9.11 = 0.69
\]

> **补充说明（如果指的是时间）**  
> - 如果把「九点一一」解释为 **9:11**，而「九点八」解释为 **9:08**（即「九点零八分」），则时间上 **9:11** 更晚，即更大。  
> - 但在常规的数值写法中，这两个写法都表示小数，所以按照数值比较，9.8 更大。
