## Physical Optics Core Implementation

The physical optics RCS calculation system implements specialized radar cross-section modeling for stealth aircraft surfaces:

1. Surface Normal Processing
`calculateRCS_PO.m`
- Custom handling of surface normal vectors relative to incident radar waves
- Specialized facet-based geometric decomposition for stealth shapes
Importance Score: 90/100

2. Radar Scattering Models
`stealth_optimizer.m`
- Physical optics approximation tailored for stealth geometries
- Domain-specific scattering calculations incorporating material properties
- Custom radar reflection modeling for angular surfaces
Importance Score: 85/100

## RCS Calculation Workflow

The calculation pipeline consists of:

1. Physical Optics Approximation
- Specialized handling of incident angles on stealth surfaces
- Custom radar scattering model optimized for low-observable geometries

2. Surface Integration
- Facet-based decomposition of aircraft geometry
- Specialized handling of edge effects and surface discontinuities

## Model Constraints

Domain-specific limitations enforced:
- Aerodynamic requirement integration in RCS calculations
- Material-specific radar absorption properties
- Surface continuity constraints for stealth features
