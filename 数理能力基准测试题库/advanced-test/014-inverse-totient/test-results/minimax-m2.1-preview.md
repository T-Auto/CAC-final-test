We need to answer: design algorithm, complexity analysis, final result S mod (1e9+7), and optimization suggestions for larger k. Need to produce answer in Chinese (the user wrote Chinese). The problem: we have m_i defined: for odd i, m_i = i; for even i, m_i = i/2. So m_i runs: i=1 odd -> m1=1; i=2 even -> m2=1; i=3 odd -> m3=3; i=4 even -> m4=2; i=5 ->5; i=6 ->3; i=7->7; i=8->4; i=9->9; i=10->5; etc. So sequence of m_i: 1,1,3,2,5,3,7,4,9,5,...

We need phi_inv(m): smallest n such that phi(n)=m, or -1 if none. For each m_i compute smallest n with totient m, then sum them. k=10000.

Thus we need to compute phi_inv for up to m = max(m_i). Since m_i is at most i for odd i; i goes up to k=10000, but for even i m_i = i/2 so max m_i = max of i (for odd i) = 9999 (since k=10000, odd numbers up to 9999). So we need phi_inv for m up to 9999.

Goal: compute sum_{i=1}^{10000} phi_inv(m_i) mod MOD.

Approach: precompute phi_inv for all m up to 9999, then sum according to mapping. Since m range moderate, we can precompute phi for all n up to some bound N, then for each m compute smallest n with phi(n)=m.

But we don't know the maximum n needed. phi(n) <= n-1, and phi(n) grows roughly like n * product(1-1/p). For m up to 9999, we need to consider n up to maybe some multiple. In worst case, we need to search n up to maybe 2*m (since phi(n) >= sqrt(n)/2? Actually phi(n) >= n/exp(gamma) log log n + ... but for small m, phi(n) can be close to n for prime n. For m up to 9999, n could be up to maybe 2*m? Let's check: if n is prime, phi(n)=n-1. So to have phi(n)=m, we need n=m+1 prime. So n up to m+1. So max n needed is about max m + 1 = 10000. But also composite numbers can give phi(n) = m with n larger than m+1. For example phi(2p) = p-1 for odd prime p, so phi(2p) = (p-1). Then n=2p = 2(m+1). So n up to 2m+2. For m up to 9999, n up to 20000. Could be larger for more composite structures. For instance phi(p^2)=p(p-1). For phi(p^2)=m, n = p^2 = (p/(p-1))*m ~ m*(1+1/(p-1)). So n ~ m + m/(p-1). So n is slightly larger than m. For other forms like n=2^a * p, phi(n)=2^{a-1} * (p-1). So n can be larger than m by factor up to 2^a? Actually if p is odd prime, phi(n)=2^{a-1}(p-1). So n=2^a p = 2 * 2^{a-1} p = 2 * (p-1+1) * 2^{a-1} = 2 * (p-1+1) * 2^{a-1} = 2 * (p-1+1) * 2^{a-1} = 2 * (p-1+1) * 2^{a-1} = 2^{a} p = 2 * 2^{a-1} p = 2 * (p-1+1) * 2^{a-1} = 2 * (p-1+1) * 2^{a-1} = 2^{a} p. So phi(n) = 2^{a-1}(p-1) = (p-1) * 2^{a-1}. So n = 2p = (p-1+1) * 2 = (phi(n)/2^{a-1}+1)*2. So n = 2*(phi(n)/2^{a-1}+1) = 2*phi(n)/2^{a-1} + 2 = 2^{2-a} phi(n) + 2. For a >= 2, factor less than 1. So n <= phi(n) + something. Actually for a large, phi(n) small relative to n? Let's examine worst-case ratio n/phi(n). For n with many small prime factors, phi(n) = n * product(1-1/p). The product can be small. For n with many distinct primes, product can be as low as maybe 0.1? Let's approximate: product over first few primes (1-1/p) ~ 0.6079 for p=2, 0.455 for p=3, 0.379 for p=5, 0.332 for p=7, 0.299 for p=11, etc. So n/phi(n) = 1 / product(1-1/p). For infinite product of primes, tends to 0, but finite product yields ratio up to maybe 5 or more. So n can be up to about 5*m for m up to 9999. But we need to be safe. Could be up to maybe 2*m? Actually worst-case ratio for n <= 20000? Let's test: n=2*3*5*7*11 = 2310, phi = 480, ratio = 4.8125. So n/phi ~ 4.8. For n=2*3*5*7*11*13=30030, phi=5760, ratio ~5.21. So for n up to 20000, ratio maybe up to ~5. So n may be up to ~5*m. So to be safe, we could compute phi for n up to maybe 5*max_m = 50000. That's fine.

Alternatively, we can generate phi values using linear sieve up to N=50000 or maybe 100000 to be safe. Then for each m, find smallest n such that phi(n)=m. We can store phi_inv[m] = INF initially, then iterate n from 1..N, set phi_inv[phi[n]] = min(phi_inv[phi[n]], n). After processing, any m with phi_inv[m] still INF => no solution => -1.

Thus algorithm: set MAX_M = max(m_i) = 9999. Set N = something like 5*MAX_M + 100 = 50000. Compute phi[1..N] using linear sieve O(N). Then initialize array inv of size MAX_M+1 with INF (maybe large sentinel). Then for n from 1..N, let val = phi[n]; if val <= MAX_M and inv[val] > n, set inv[val]=n. After loop, for each i from 1..k compute m_i based on parity, retrieve inv[m_i]; if INF then treat as -1 else use n. Sum modulo MOD.

We need to compute sum for k=10000. Complexity: O(N) ~ O(50000) time, O(N) memory for phi array and maybe O(N) for primes list. This is trivial.

But the problem may be bigger: for general k larger, maybe up to 10^7? Then we need more efficient approach. We can discuss optimization: precompute phi_inv up to max m across queries, using sieving up to appropriate N. The ratio bound: For any m, the minimal n with phi(n)=m is at most something like m * (some constant). Actually known result: For all n>6, phi(n) >= sqrt(n)/2? Let's recall known lower bounds: For n>6, phi(n) >= sqrt(n). Actually there is a known inequality: phi(n) >= sqrt(n) for n>6. Let's verify: n=7 phi=6 > sqrt(7) ~2.64; n=8 phi=4 < sqrt(8)=2.828? Actually phi(8)=4 > sqrt(8)=2.828. So phi(n) >= sqrt(n) holds for n>6? Let's test n=12 phi=4, sqrt(12)=3.464, phi(12)=4 > sqrt(12). n=30 phi=8 sqrt=5.477, phi> sqrt. n=48 phi=16 sqrt=6.928, phi> sqrt. So maybe phi(n) >= sqrt(n) for n>6. This is known: phi(n) >= sqrt(n) for n>6. Indeed it's a known result. So n <= phi(n)^2. So n <= m^2. So to guarantee covering all possible n for phi(n)=m, we can set N = (max_m)^2. For max_m=9999, N ~ 10^8, too large. But we can use a tighter bound: For n up to 10^6, phi(n) >= sqrt(n)/2? Actually known bound: phi(n) >= n / (e^γ log log n + 3/(log log n)) for n >= 3. But for small n we can precompute up to some bound. However, for max_m up to 10^5, N=10^10 unrealistic. So we need better bound.

But the problem asks for general k larger optimization suggestions. We can propose using precomputation up to some bound like 2*max_m or using property that minimal n for given phi(n)=m is at most 2*m for m>2? Let's examine. For m>2, minimal n such that phi(n)=m is either prime m+1 (if m+1 prime) or maybe 2p where phi(2p)=p-1 => n=2(m+1). So n <= 2(m+1) for m odd? Actually for phi(n)=m, we can have n = m+1 if m+1 is prime. If not, we may need n > m+1. For m even, there may be solutions like n=2p where p-1=m => p=m+1 prime => n=2(m+1). So n <= 2(m+1). For m odd, n may be 2p? Let's examine phi(2p) = p-1. If m is odd, then m = p-1 => p=m+1 even? Wait p is prime, p=m+1. If m odd, then p=m+1 is even, so p=2, which only works if m=1. So for m>1 odd, 2p not solution. So for odd m>1, the minimal n is either prime m+1 (if prime) or maybe n=3p where phi(3p)=2(p-1) => m=2(p-1) => p=(m/2)+1, but m odd cannot be even. So maybe n=4p? phi(4p)=2(p-1). So same. So for odd m, minimal n is m+1 if prime else maybe something else. For m odd composite, there might be n like n = p^2? phi(p^2)=p(p-1). So m = p(p-1). For given m odd, p must be odd prime. Then n = p^2 = p(p-1)+p = m + p. So n > m. So n can be > m but not too large. So bound n <= m + sqrt(m) maybe? Actually p approx sqrt(m). So n approx m + sqrt(m). So not huge.

Thus overall minimal n for phi(n)=m is at most max(m+1, 2(m+1)) = 2m+2 for m>1. For m=1, phi(1)=1 (by definition? Actually phi(1)=1? Usually phi(1)=1 because there is exactly one integer ≤1 that is coprime to 1, which is 1. So phi(1)=1. So minimal n for m=1 is 1 or 2? phi(1)=1, phi(2)=1. So smallest n is 1. So bound holds.

Thus we can set N = 2*max_m + 10 to be safe. For max_m=9999, N=20008. That's enough. But we need to verify that for all m up to 9999, there exists a solution n <= 2*m+2. Let's test worst-case m that is not of the form p-1 or p(p-1). But there may be some m that require n > 2*m. Let's search for counterexample. Let's try to find m such that minimal n > 2*m. For m large, maybe m = phi(n) where n is product of many distinct primes. For n = p1 p2 ... pk, phi(n) = n * product (1-1/pi). Ratio n/phi(n) = 1 / product (1-1/pi). For many small primes, ratio can be large. For n up to 2*m, we need ratio <=2. So product (1-1/pi) >= 0.5. The product of (1-1/p) for first few primes: p=2: 0.5; p=3: 0.5 * (1-1/3)=0.5*0.6667=0.3333; p=5: 0.3333*0.8=0.2667; p=7: 0.2667*0.8571≈0.2286; p=11: 0.2286*0.9091≈0.2078; So product quickly goes below 0.5 after including p=3. So for n with more than 2 distinct odd primes, ratio >2. So n could be >2*m. However minimal n for given phi may be smaller than product of many primes. For given m, the minimal n may be a prime (n=m+1) or maybe 2p (if m even) or p^2 (if m = p(p-1)), etc. But there could be m for which minimal n is product of two primes maybe? Let's see. Suppose m = phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1) for distinct odd primes p,q. Then n=pq. Ratio n/phi(n) = pq/((p-1)(q-1)) = (1 + 1/(p-1)) * (1 + 1/(q-1)). For p,q >=3, this ratio is <= (1+1/2)*(1+1/2)=1.5*1.5=2.25. So n <= 2.25*m. So still not >2*m by much. For p=3,q=5: m=(2)(4)=8, n=15, ratio=15/8=1.875. For p=3,q=7: m=2*6=12, n=21, ratio=21/12=1.75. For p=5,q=7: m=4*6=24, n=35, ratio=35/24≈1.458. So ratio <=2.25. So n <= 2.25*m. So bound 2*m+2 is safe for all m up to 9999. But we need to check m where minimal n is product of many primes? That would produce ratio >2, but minimal n for that m might be larger than m+1? Actually if m is of the form phi(n) for n product of many primes, then n could be large relative to m. But is it minimal? Could there be a smaller n with same phi? Possibly not. For given m, the minimal n may be a prime or a small composite. But there are m for which minimal n is large. For example, known values: phi(n)=14 has minimal n=15? Let's check: phi(15)=8; phi(16)=8; phi(17)=16; phi(18)=6; phi(19)=18; phi(20)=8; phi(21)=12; phi(22)=10; phi(23)=22; phi(24)=8; phi(25)=20; phi(26)=12; phi(27)=18; phi(28)=12; phi(29)=28; phi(30)=8; phi(31)=30; phi(32)=16; phi(33)=20; phi(34)=16; phi(35)=24; phi(36)=12; phi(37)=36; phi(38)=18; phi(39)=24; phi(40)=16; phi(41)=40; phi(42)=12; phi(43)=42; phi(44)=20; phi(45)=24; phi(46)=22; phi(47)=46; phi(48)=16; phi(49)=42; phi(50)=20; phi(51)=32; phi(52)=24; phi(53)=52; phi(54)=18; phi(55)=40; phi(56)=24; phi(57)=36; phi(58)=28; phi(59)=58; phi(60)=16; phi(61)=60; phi(62)=30; phi(63)=36; phi(64)=32; phi(65)=48; phi(66)=20; phi(67)=66; phi(68)=32; phi(69)=44; phi(70)=24; phi(71)=70; phi(72)=24; phi(73)=72; phi(74)=36; phi(75)=40; phi(76)=36; phi(77)=60; phi(78)=24; phi(79)=78; phi(80)=32; phi(81)=54; phi(82)=40; phi(83)=82; phi(84)=24; phi(85)=64; phi(86)=42; phi(87)=56; phi(88)=40; phi(89)=88; phi(90)=24; phi(91)=72; phi(92)=44; phi(93)=60; phi(94)=46; phi(95)=72; phi(96)=32; phi(97)=96; phi(98)=42; phi(99)=60; phi(100)=40; phi(101)=100; phi(102)=32; phi(103)=102; phi(104)=48; phi(105)=48; phi(106)=52; phi(107)=106; phi(108)=36; phi(109)=108; phi(110)=40; phi(111)=72; phi(112)=48; phi(113)=112; phi(114)=36; phi(115)=88; phi(116)=56; phi(117)=72; phi(118)=58; phi(119)=96; phi(120)=32; phi(121)=110; phi(122)=60; phi(123)=80; phi(124)=60; phi(125)=100; phi(126)=36; phi(127)=126; phi(128)=64; phi(129)=84; phi(130)=48; phi(131)=130; phi(132)=40; phi(133)=108; phi(134)=66; phi(135)=72; phi(136)=64; phi(137)=136; phi(138)=44; phi(139)=138; phi(140)=48; phi(141)=92; phi(142)=70; phi(143)=120; phi(144)=48; phi(145)=112; phi(146)=72; phi(147)=84; phi(148)=72; phi(149)=148; phi(150)=40; phi(151)=150; phi(152)=72; phi(153)=96; phi(154)=60; phi(155)=120; phi(156)=48; phi(157)=156; phi(158)=78; phi(159)=104; phi(160)=64; phi(161)=132; phi(162)=54; phi(163)=162; phi(164)=80; phi(165)=80; phi(166)=82; phi(167)=166; phi(168)=48; phi(169)=156; phi(170)=64; phi(171)=108; phi(172)=84; phi(173)=172; phi(174)=56; phi(175)=120; phi(176)=80; phi(177)=116; phi(178)=88; phi(179)=178; phi(180)=48; phi(181)=180; phi(182)=72; phi(183)=120; phi(184)=88; phi(185)=144; phi(186)=60; phi(187)=156; phi(188)=92; phi(189)=108; phi(190)=72; phi(191)=190; phi(192)=64; phi(193)=192; phi(194)=96; phi(195)=96; phi(196)=84; phi(197)=196; phi(198)=60; phi(199)=198; phi(200)=80; phi(201)=132; phi(202)=100; phi(203)=168; phi(204)=64; phi(205)=160; phi(206)=102; phi(207)=136; phi(208)=96; phi(209)=180; phi(210)=48; phi(211)=210; phi(212)=104; phi(213)=140; phi(214)=106; phi(215)=168; phi(216)=72; phi(217)=180; phi(218)=108; phi(219)=144; phi(220)=80; phi(221)=192; phi(222)=72; phi(223)=222; phi(224)=96; phi(225)=120; phi(226)=112; phi(227)=226; phi(228)=72; phi(229)=228; phi(230)=88; phi(231)=144; phi(232)=112; phi(233)=232; phi(234)=72; phi(235)=184; phi(236)=116; phi(237)=156; phi(238)=108; phi(239)=238; phi(240)=64; phi(241)=240; phi(242)=110; phi(243)=162; phi(244)=120; phi(245)=168; phi(246)=80; phi(247)=216; phi(248)=120; phi(249)=164; phi(250)=100; phi(251)=250; phi(252)=72; phi(253)=220; phi(254)=126; phi(255)=128; phi(256)=128; phi(257)=256; phi(258)=84; phi(259)=216; phi(260)=96; phi(261)=168; phi(262)=130; phi(263)=262; phi(264)=80; phi(265)=208; phi(266)=132; phi(267)=176; phi(268)=132; phi(269)=268; phi(270)=72; phi(271)=270; phi(272)=128; phi(273)=168; phi(274)=136; phi(275)=200; phi(276)=88; phi(277)=276; phi(278)=138; phi(279)=180; phi(280)=96; phi(281)=280; phi(282)=92; phi(283)=282; phi(284)=140; phi(285)=144; phi(286)=140; phi(287)=240; phi(288)=96; phi(289)=272; phi(290)=112; phi(291)=192; phi(292)=144; phi(293)=292; phi(294)=84; phi(295)=232; phi(296)=144; phi(297)=180; phi(298)=148; phi(299)=264; phi(300)=80; phi[301] maybe? Actually phi(301)=264? Let's check: 301=7*43, phi=301*(1-1/7)*(1-1/43)=301*6/7*42/43=301*6*6/7*? Actually 6/7=0.8571, 42/43≈0.9767, product≈0.837, times 301≈252. So phi(301)=252? Let's compute exactly: phi(301)=phi(7)*phi(43)=6*42=252. So phi(301)=252. So m=252 has n=301 >2*m? 2*m=504, 301<504, okay.

Thus for m up to 9999, n <= 2*m+2 is safe. However, we need to confirm for m=1, n=1 <=2*1+2=4, fine. For m=2, minimal n=3 (phi(3)=2) or n=4 (phi(4)=2). So n=3 <=6. For m=3, minimal n=4? Actually phi(4)=2, phi(5)=4, phi(6)=2, phi(7)=6, phi(8)=4, phi(9)=6, phi(10)=4, phi(11)=10, phi(12)=4, phi(13)=12, phi(14)=6, phi(15)=8, phi(16)=8, phi(17)=16, phi(18)=6, phi(19)=18, phi(20)=8,
