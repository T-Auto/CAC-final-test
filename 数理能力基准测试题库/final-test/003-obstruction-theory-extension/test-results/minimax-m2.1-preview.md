The user asks:

"Let $X = \text{Spec}(k[[x,y]]/I) \subset \mathbb{A}^2$, where $I = (x^2, xy, y^2)$. Let $\mathfrak{m} = (x,y) \subset k[[x,y]]$. Set $V = \text{Hom}_k(I/\mathfrak{m}I, k)$. Then $V$ is the obstruction space for the canonical obstruction theory for the local ring of $X$ at the origin.

Consider the following special kind of extension problems. For $k=1, 2, 3, \dots$,

```
Spec(k[t]/(t^k)) → Spec(k[t]/(t^{k+1}))
       ↓                    ↓ (dashed)
       X ←------------------
```

where the unique point of $\text{Spec}(k[[t]]/(t^k))$ is mapped to the origin.

Find all the elements in $V$ that show up as obstruction classes for this special kind of extension problems.

[Remark: A priori, the obstruction classes live in $V \otimes (t^k)/(t^{k+1})$. To identify it with $V$, we need to choose a basis for the 1-dimensional vector space $(t^k)/(t^{k+1})$. Of course there is a natural choice. But you will see that the answer to this problem is indeed independent of the choice.]"

We need to answer this question. Let's restate the problem in more mathematical terms.

We have $X = \text{Spec}(k[[x,y]]/I)$ where $I = (x^2, xy, y^2)$. So $X$ is the spectrum of the local ring $R = k[[x,y]]/(x^2, xy, y^2)$. This is a 0-dimensional local ring (since the ideal is maximal? Actually $(x,y)$ is the maximal ideal of $k[[x,y]]$, and $I = (x^2, xy, y^2)$ is contained in $\mathfrak{m}^2$. So $R = k[[x,y]]/(x^2, xy, y^2)$ is isomorphic to $k \oplus \mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2$? Let's compute: $k[[x,y]] = k \oplus \mathfrak{m} \oplus \mathfrak{m}^2 \oplus \dots$. The ideal $I$ is the ideal generated by $x^2, xy, y^2$, which is $\mathfrak{m}^2$ except for the linear terms? Actually $\mathfrak{m}^2 = (x^2, xy, y^2)$. So $I = \mathfrak{m}^2$. So $R = k[[x,y]]/\mathfrak{m}^2$? Wait, $I = (x^2, xy, y^2) = \mathfrak{m}^2$. Indeed $\mathfrak{m}^2$ is generated by all monomials of degree 2: $x^2$, $xy$, $y^2$. So $I = \mathfrak{m}^2$. So $R = k[[x,y]]/\mathfrak{m}^2$.

Thus $R$ is the "first-order thickening" of the origin in $\mathbb{A}^2$, i.e., the scheme given by the square of the maximal ideal. It's a local Artinian ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_R = (x,y)/\mathfrak{m}^2$ (the image of $\mathfrak{m}$). So $\mathfrak{m}_R$ is a 2-dimensional $k$-vector space spanned by the classes of $x$ and $y$, and $\mathfrak{m}_R^2 = 0$ because $x^2, xy, y^2$ are zero.

Thus $R$ is isomorphic to the dual numbers in two variables: $R \cong k \oplus \mathfrak{m}_R$, with $\mathfrak{m}_R$ a 2-dimensional $k$-vector space.

Now we have $V = \text{Hom}_k(I/\mathfrak{m} I, k)$. Since $I = \mathfrak{m}^2$, we have $\mathfrak{m} I = \mathfrak{m}^3$. Since $\mathfrak{m}^3 \subset \mathfrak{m}^2$, we have $I/\mathfrak{m} I = \mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3$. But $\mathfrak{m}^3$ is the ideal generated by monomials of degree 3: $x^3, x^2 y, x y^2, y^3$. So $I/\mathfrak{m} I = \mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3$ is a $k$-vector space of dimension equal to the number of monomials of degree 2, i.e., $\dim_k \mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3 = \binom{2+1-1}{2} = \binom{2}{2} = 1? Wait, we need to compute the dimension of $\mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3$ for the power series ring $k[[x,y]]$. In general, for $k[[x_1,\dots,x_n]]$, $\mathfrak{m}^d / \mathfrak{m}^{d+1}$ is isomorphic to the degree $d$ part of the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ (since higher terms vanish modulo $\mathfrak{m}^{d+1}$). So $\mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3$ is the space of homogeneous degree 2 polynomials in $x,y$, which has dimension $\binom{2+2-1}{2} = \binom{3}{2} = 3$. Indeed monomials $x^2$, $xy$, $y^2$ form a basis. So $I/\mathfrak{m}I = \mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3$ has dimension 3. So $V = \text{Hom}_k(\mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3, k)$ has dimension 3 as well.

Thus $V$ is a 3-dimensional $k$-vector space spanned by linear functionals dual to $x^2$, $xy$, $y^2$.

Now the obstruction theory: The canonical obstruction theory for the local ring of $X$ at the origin presumably yields an obstruction class in $V$ (or $V \otimes (t^k)/(t^{k+1})$) for each extension problem. The question asks: For the specific extension problems where we have a morphism $\Spec(k[t]/(t^k)) \to X$ (the unique point of $\Spec(k[t]/(t^k))$ maps to the origin), and we want to extend it to $\Spec(k[t]/(t^{k+1}))$, find all elements in $V$ that appear as obstruction classes for these extension problems (for all $k$). In other words, consider the set of all obstruction classes for each $k$, as elements of $V$ (identifying $V \otimes (t^k)/(t^{k+1}) \cong V$). Which elements of $V$ can appear? Perhaps the whole $V$? Or maybe a subspace? Let's analyze.

First, recall the obstruction theory for deformations of a map to a local complete intersection. For a map $f: S \to X$ from a scheme $S$ to a scheme $X$, the obstruction to extending a deformation $S' \to X$ over $S' \cup_{S} S'$ (i.e., to extend from $S$ to $S'$) lies in $\Ext^1(L_{X/S}, \mathcal{O}_S)$ or something. However, in this case $X$ is a closed subscheme of $\mathbb{A}^2$ defined by the ideal $I = \mathfrak{m}^2$, and we are considering deformations of the inclusion of the origin into $X$ along a thickening $S_k = \Spec(k[t]/(t^k))$ mapping to $X$ via the unique point. The extension problem is to extend the morphism $S_k \to X$ to $S_{k+1} = \Spec(k[t]/(t^{k+1}))$. Since $S_k$ is a nilpotent thickening of the origin, we need to find a morphism $S_{k+1} \to X$ extending the given one.

Given that $X$ is defined by $I = (x^2, xy, y^2)$, a morphism $S_{k+1} \to X$ corresponds to a $k$-algebra homomorphism $\phi: R = k[[x,y]]/\mathfrak{m}^2 \to k[t]/(t^{k+1})$ such that $\phi(x), \phi(y)$ are nilpotent elements (since the image lies in $(t) \subset k[t]/(t^{k+1})$). The given morphism $S_k \to X$ corresponds to a homomorphism $\phi_k: R \to k[t]/(t^k)$ sending $x, y$ to some elements $a,b \in (t) \subset k[t]/(t^k)$ (i.e., nilpotent of order at most $k$). The obstruction to extending $\phi_k$ to $\phi_{k+1}$ is an element of $V \otimes (t^k)/(t^{k+1}) \cong V$. We need to compute that obstruction explicitly.

Alternatively, we can think of $X$ as a "fat point" of length $\dim_k R = 1 + \dim_k \mathfrak{m}_R = 1 + 2 = 3$. So $R$ is a local Artinian $k$-algebra of length 3. The morphism $S_{k+1} \to X$ corresponds to a $k$-algebra homomorphism $R \to k[t]/(t^{k+1})$. Since $R$ is local with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_R$, the image of $\mathfrak{m}_R$ must be nilpotent (since $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$ is local with maximal ideal $(t)$). So the obstruction is about lifting a homomorphism from $R$ to $k[t]/(t^k)$ to $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$.

Given $R = k \oplus \mathfrak{m}_R$ with $\mathfrak{m}_R^2 = 0$, any $k$-algebra homomorphism $\phi: R \to A$ (where $A$ is a $k$-algebra) is determined by the images $u = \phi(\bar{x})$ and $v = \phi(\bar{y})$ in $A$, where $\bar{x}, \bar{y}$ are the classes of $x$ and $y$ in $R$. Since $\mathfrak{m}_R^2 = 0$, the relations $x^2 = xy = y^2 = 0$ in $R$ imply that $u^2 = uv = v^2 = 0$ in $A$ (since $\phi$ is a homomorphism). Conversely, any $u, v \in A$ satisfying $u^2 = uv = v^2 = 0$ define a $k$-algebra homomorphism $R \to A$ sending $x \mapsto u$, $y \mapsto v$.

Thus a morphism $S_{k+1} \to X$ corresponds to a pair $(u,v) \in (t) \subset k[t]/(t^{k+1})$ such that $u^2 = uv = v^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$. Since $t$ is nilpotent of order $k+1$, any element $u = a t^i$ with $i \ge 1$, $a \in k$, is nilpotent: $u^2 = a^2 t^{2i}$. So $u^2 = 0$ if $2i \ge k+1$? Actually $t^{k+1} = 0$, so $u^2 = a^2 t^{2i} = 0$ if $2i \ge k+1$, i.e., $i \ge (k+1)/2$. Similarly for $v^2$ and $uv$.

Thus the condition $u^2 = uv = v^2 = 0$ imposes constraints on the orders of vanishing of $u$ and $v$.

Given a morphism $S_k \to X$, we have $u_k, v_k \in (t) \subset k[t]/(t^k)$ satisfying $u_k^2 = u_k v_k = v_k^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^k)$. To extend to $S_{k+1}$, we need to find $u_{k+1}, v_{k+1} \in (t) \subset k[t]/(t^{k+1})$ such that $u_{k+1} \equiv u_k \mod t^k$, $v_{k+1} \equiv v_k \mod t^k$, and $u_{k+1}^2 = u_{k+1} v_{k+1} = v_{k+1}^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$.

The obstruction to such extension is given by the failure to satisfy the relations modulo $t^{k+1}$. Since $u_k, v_k$ satisfy the relations modulo $t^k$, the obstruction is something like $u_k^2$ (mod $t^{k+1}$), etc. Actually $u_{k+1}^2$ must be zero in $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$, but $u_k^2$ is zero modulo $t^k$, i.e., $u_k^2 = a t^k$ for some $a \in k$ (since $u_k^2$ is a multiple of $t^k$). So $u_k^2 = a t^k$, which is not zero in $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$ unless $a = 0$. Similarly for $v_k^2$ and $u_k v_k$.

Thus the obstruction is essentially the triple $(a,b,c) \in k^3$ given by $u_k^2 = a t^k$, $v_k^2 = b t^k$, $u_k v_k = c t^k$ (mod $t^{k+1}$). Since $u_k, v_k$ are in $(t)$, each is of the form $u_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} u_i t^i$, $v_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} v_i t^i$, with $u_i, v_i \in k$. Then $u_k^2 = (\sum u_i t^i)^2 = \sum_{i+j \ge k} u_i u_j t^{i+j} \mod t^{k+1}$, but since $i,j \ge 1$, $i+j \ge 2$, so $u_k^2$ is a linear combination of $t^m$ for $m \ge 2$. The obstruction is the coefficient of $t^k$ in $u_k^2$, $v_k^2$, $u_k v_k$, i.e., $a = \sum_{i+j = k} u_i u_j$, $b = \sum_{i+j = k} v_i v_j$, $c = \sum_{i+j = k} u_i v_j$. So the obstruction is a triple $(a,b,c) \in k^3$.

Now $V$ is $\operatorname{Hom}_k(\mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3, k)$. $\mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3$ is spanned by $x^2$, $xy$, $y^2$. So $V$ can be identified with $k^3$ by mapping a linear functional $\alpha$ to $(\alpha(x^2), \alpha(xy), \alpha(y^2))$.

Thus the obstruction class is $(a,b,c) \in k^3$, i.e., an element of $V$. The question asks: Which elements of $V$ appear as obstruction classes for the special extension problems (for all $k$)? In other words, as we vary $k$ and the morphisms $S_k \to X$, what possible obstruction triples $(a,b,c)$ can appear? Are all triples possible? Or perhaps only those satisfying some condition (like $a b = c^2$ or something)? Let's examine.

We need to find the set of all possible $(a,b,c)$ that can arise from some $k$ and some morphism $S_k \to X$. Since $k$ can be arbitrarily large, perhaps any triple can be realized for some $k$ (maybe with appropriate $u_k$, $v_k$). But there might be constraints: Since $u_k^2$, $v_k^2$, $u_k v_k$ are all zero modulo $t^k$, the coefficients $a,b,c$ are determined by the coefficients of $u_k$ and $v_k$ at various degrees. There might be some relation among $a,b,c$ due to the fact that $u_k^2$, $v_k^2$, $u_k v_k$ are not independent? Actually $u_k^2$, $v_k^2$, $u_k v_k$ are each computed from $u_k$, $v_k$, so they satisfy some algebraic relations: For any $u,v$, we have $(u+v)^2 = u^2 + v^2 + 2 uv$, etc. But the triple $(a,b,c)$ is just the coefficient of $t^k$ in $u_k^2$, $v_k^2$, $u_k v_k$, which are independent in general: we can choose $u_k$ and $v_k$ arbitrarily, then compute $a,b,c$. So perhaps any triple $(a,b,c) \in k^3$ can be realized.

But there might be constraints due to the fact that $u_k$ and $v_k$ are elements of $k[t]/(t^k)$ with $u_k^2 = uv = v_k^2 = 0$ modulo $t^k$. Actually we need to impose the condition that $u_k^2$, $u_k v_k$, $v_k^2$ are zero modulo $t^k$. That imposes constraints on $u_k$ and $v_k$. However, $u_k$ and $v_k$ can be any nilpotent elements of order at most $k-1$? Let's examine.

The condition $u_k^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^k)$ means that the coefficient of $t^m$ in $u_k^2$ is zero for all $m < k$. Since $u_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} u_i t^i$, $u_k^2 = \sum_{i+j \ge 2} u_i u_j t^{i+j}$. For $i+j < k$, we need $u_i u_j = 0$. Similarly for $v_k$ and $u_k v_k$.

Thus $u_k$ and $v_k$ cannot be arbitrary; they must satisfy that all pairwise products of coefficients $u_i u_j$, $v_i v_j$, $u_i v_j$ vanish for all $i+j < k$.

But we can choose $u_k$ and $v_k$ such that the obstruction triple $(a,b,c)$ is any desired triple, while still satisfying these constraints. Let's think: For a given $k$, we can set $u_k = u_{k-1} t^{k-1}$ (i.e., a single term) and $v_k = v_{k-1} t^{k-1}$ (single term). Then $u_k^2 = u_{k-1}^2 t^{2(k-1)}$. If $2(k-1) < k$, i.e., $2k-2 < k$, i.e., $k < 2$, then $u_k^2$ is non-zero modulo $t^k$ and would violate the condition. But for $k \ge 2$, $2(k-1) \ge k$? Let's check: $2(k-1) = 2k-2$. For $k=2$, $2k-2 = 2$, which equals $k=2$, so $u_k^2 = u_{k-1}^2 t^2$ is zero modulo $t^2$? Actually modulo $t^2$, $t^2 = 0$, so $u_k^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^2)$. So $u_k^2 = 0$ automatically for $k=2$. For $k=3$, $2(k-1) = 4$, which is > $k=3$, so $u_k^2$ is zero modulo $t^3$. So for $k \ge 3$, any monomial $u_k = a t^{k-1}$ yields $u_k^2 = a^2 t^{2(k-1)}$, which is zero modulo $t^k$ because $2(k-1) \ge k$ for $k \ge 2$. Indeed $2(k-1) \ge k$ iff $2k-2 \ge k$ iff $k \ge 2$. So for $k \ge 2$, any $u_k$ of the form $a t^{k-1}$ automatically satisfies $u_k^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^k)$. Similarly for $v_k$.

Thus for $k \ge 2$, we can choose $u_k = a t^{k-1}$, $v_k = b t^{k-1}$ with $a,b \in k$. Then $u_k^2 = 0$, $v_k^2 = 0$, $u_k v_k = a b t^{2(k-1)}$, which is also zero modulo $t^k$ because $2(k-1) \ge k$ for $k \ge 2$. So these choices satisfy the condition that $u_k^2$, $v_k^2$, $u_k v_k$ are zero modulo $t^k$.

Thus for $k \ge 2$, we can have $u_k$ and $v_k$ with only the top-degree term non-zero, and they satisfy the relations. For $k=1$, $S_1 = \Spec(k)$ (the point), and the morphism $S_1 \to X$ is just the inclusion of the origin; there is no obstruction because $S_1 \to X$ always exists uniquely. So $k=1$ is trivial.

Thus for $k \ge 2$, we have many possibilities. For a given $k$, we can also consider $u_k$ having lower-degree terms. But we can use the simplest case: $u_k = a t^{k-1}$, $v_k = b t^{k-1}$. Then the obstruction to extending to $S_{k+1}$ is determined by $a,b$ and the extension. Let's compute the obstruction for this case.

Given $u_k = a t^{k-1}$, $v_k = b t^{k-1}$ in $k[t]/(t^k)$, we want to find $u_{k+1}, v_{k+1}$ in $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$ that reduce to $u_k, v_k$ modulo $t^k$ and satisfy $u_{k+1}^2 = u_{k+1} v_{k+1} = v_{k+1}^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$.

Write $u_{k+1} = a t^{k-1} + u_k' t^k$, where $u_k' \in k$ is a new coefficient (the coefficient of $t^k$). Similarly $v_{k+1} = b t^{k-1} + v_k' t^k$.

Now compute $u_{k+1}^2 = (a t^{k-1} + u_k' t^k)^2 = a^2 t^{2(k-1)} + 2 a u_k' t^{(k-1)+k} + (u_k')^2 t^{2k}$. Since $t^{2k} = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$, we can ignore the last term. So $u_{k+1}^2 = a^2 t^{2(k-1)} + 2 a u_k' t^{2k-1}$. Since $t^{2k-1}$ is also zero modulo $t^{k+1}$ if $2k-1 \ge k+1$, i.e., $k \ge 2$? Let's check: $2k-1 \ge k+1$ iff $k \ge 2$. For $k=2$, $2k-1 = 3$, $k+1 = 3$, so equality; for $k>2$, it's strictly greater. So for $k \ge 2$, $t^{2k-1}$ is zero modulo $t^{k+1}$ because $2k-1 \ge k+1$. Indeed $2k-1 \ge k+1$ iff $k \ge 2$. So the second term $2 a u_k' t^{2k-1}$ is zero in $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$ for $k \ge 2$. So $u_{k+1}^2 = a^2 t^{2(k-1)}$ modulo $t^{k+1}$.

Thus the condition $u_{k+1}^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$ forces $a^2 t^{2(k-1)} = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^{k+1})$, which means $a^2 = 0$ if $2(k-1) < k+1$? Actually $t^{2(k-1)}$ is zero modulo $t^{k+1}$ if $2(k-1) \ge k+1$, i.e., $2k-2 \ge k+1$ => $k \ge 3$. For $k=2$, $2(k-1) = 2$, $k+1 = 3$, so $t^2$ is not zero modulo $t^3$, so $a^2 t^2$ must be zero, which forces $a^2 = 0$ in $k$. Since $k$ is a field (presumably characteristic not 2?), $a^2 = 0$ implies $a = 0$. So for $k=2$, $a$ must be zero. For $k \ge 3$, $t^{2(k-1)}$ is zero modulo $t^{k+1}$ automatically, so no condition on $a$.

Similarly for $v_{k+1}^2 = b^2 t^{2(k-1)}$, and $u_{k+1} v_{k+1} = a b t^{2(k-1)} + (a v_k' + b u_k') t^{2k-1} + ...$ The cross term $a v_k' + b u_k' t^{2k-1}$ is zero modulo $t^{k+1}$ for $k \ge 2$ as above. So $u_{k+1} v_{k+1} = a b t^{2(k-1)}$ modulo $t^{k+1}$.

Thus for $k=2$, the obstruction condition is $a^2 = 0$, $b^2 = 0$, $a b = 0$ in $k$. So $a = b = 0$. So for $k=2$, any morphism $S_2 \to X$ must have $u_2 = 0$, $v_2 = 0$? Actually $S_2 = \Spec(k[t]/(t^2))$, and $u_2$ and $v_2$ must satisfy $u_2^2 = v_2^2 = u_2 v_2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^2)$. Since $t^2 = 0$, any $u_2 = a t$, $v_2 = b t$ satisfy $u_2^2 = a^2 t^2 = 0$, $v_2^2 = b^2 t^2 = 0$, $u_2 v_2 = a b t^2 = 0$. So any $a,b$ are allowed. So there are no restrictions on $a,b$ for $S_2 \to X$. Wait, earlier we said $u_k^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^k)$ imposes constraints. But for $k=2$, $t^2 = 0$, so any $u_2 = a t$ automatically yields $u_2^2 = a^2 t^2 = 0$. So indeed there are no constraints. So $S_2 \to X$ corresponds to any pair $(a,b) \in k^2$.

Thus for $k=2$, the obstruction to extending to $S_3$ is given by $a^2$, $b^2$, $a b$ in $k$, i.e., the triple $(a^2, b^2, a b)$. So the obstruction classes that appear for $k=2$ are all triples of the form $(a^2, b^2, a b)$ for $a,b \in k$. This is the set $\{ (a^2, b^2, a b) : a,b \in k \}$. This is a subset of $k^3$, which is the image of the map $k^2 \to k^3$, $(a,b) \mapsto (a^2, b^2, a b)$. In characteristic not 2, this is a quadratic cone: the set of triples $(p,q,r)$ such that $p q = r^2$? Let's check: $(a^2)(b^2) = (a b)^2$, so indeed $p q = r^2$. So the obstruction triples satisfy $p q = r^2$. Also $p,q$ are squares. But any triple satisfying $p q = r^2$ can be realized? Not exactly: If $k$ is algebraically closed or infinite, any such triple can be written as $(a^2, b^2, a b)$ for some $a,b \in k$ (choose $a = \sqrt{p}$, $b = \sqrt{q}$). But if $k$ is not algebraically closed, there may be squares missing. However, the problem likely assumes $k$ is an arbitrary field (maybe algebraically closed). The answer may be independent of $k$ (the field). The problem statement says "for $k=1,2,3,\dots$", but $k$ is the exponent in the extension problem, not the field. The field is $k$ (the base field). The problem uses $k$ for both the field and the exponent? Actually the problem uses $k$ as the exponent in the thickening: $\Spec(k[t]/(t^k)) \to X$, where $k$ is a positive integer. The base field is $k$ (maybe a field $k$). So there is a conflict of notation: The base field is $k$ and the exponent is $k$ as well. Usually we denote the base field as $k$ and the exponent as $n$ or $m$. But the problem uses $k$ for the exponent and also the base field. That's okay but we need to be careful. Let's denote the base field as $\Bbbk$ (or $k$ as a field). The exponent as $n$ maybe. But the problem says "For $k=1,2,3,\dots$". So the exponent is $k$ (a positive integer). The base field is also $k$? That seems ambiguous. Usually the base field is denoted $k$, but they also use $k$ for exponent. That is confusing. Let's assume the base field is $k$ (the same letter) but it's a field, not an integer. The exponent is also an integer, also denoted $k$. So we need to be careful: The base field $k$ is a field, and the exponent $k$ is a positive integer. The problem uses the same letter, but it's okay as long as we differentiate context.

Thus for each exponent $n$, the obstruction class lies in $V \otimes (t^n)/(t^{n+1}) \cong V$. The set of obstruction classes for all $n$ is the union over $n$ of those classes.

Thus the problem asks: "Find all the elements in $V$ that show up as obstruction classes for this special kind of extension problems." So we need to describe the set $O \subseteq V$ of all possible obstruction classes.

From the analysis above, for $n=2$, the obstruction classes are $(a^2, b^2, a b) \in k^3$. For $n=3$, we need to compute the obstruction classes for $S_3 \to X$ and extending to $S_4$. Let's compute for $n=3$.

For $n=3$, $S_3 = \Spec(k[t]/(t^3))$. The condition $u_3^2 = u_3 v_3 = v_3^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^3)$ imposes constraints: $u_3 = u_1 t + u_2 t^2$, $v_3 = v_1 t + v_2 t^2$. Then $u_3^2 = u_1^2 t^2 + 2 u_1 u_2 t^3$, but $t^3 = 0$ modulo $t^3$, so $u_3^2 = u_1^2 t^2$. So the condition $u_3^2 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^3)$ forces $u_1^2 = 0$ in $k$. Similarly $v_1^2 = 0$, and $u_3 v_3 = (u_1 t + u_2 t^2)(v_1 t + v_2 t^2) = u_1 v_1 t^2 + (u_1 v_2 + u_2 v_1) t^3$, which reduces modulo $t^3$ to $u_1 v_1 t^2$, so we need $u_1 v_1 = 0$.

Thus for $n=3$, the constraints are: $u_1^2 = 0$, $v_1^2 = 0$, $u_1 v_1 = 0$. So $u_1$ and $v_1$ must be nilpotent elements of $k$ (i.e., zero) unless $k$ has nilpotents. Since $k$ is a field, the only nilpotent element is $0$. So $u_1 = v_1 = 0$. So $u_3 = u_2 t^2$, $v_3 = v_2 t^2$. So $u_3$ and $v_3$ are multiples of $t^2$.

Thus for $n=3$, any morphism $S_3 \to X$ is given by $u_3 = a t^2$, $v_3 = b t^2$, with $a,b \in k$. Indeed $u_3^2 = a^2 t^4 = 0$ modulo $t^3$, etc. So the obstruction to extending to $S_4$ is given by $a^2$, $b^2$, $a b$ again? Let's compute.

Given $u_3 = a t^2$, $v_3 = b t^2$, we want $u_4 = a t^2 + u_3' t^3$, $v_4 = b t^2 + v_3' t^3$. Compute $u_4^2 = a^2 t^4 + 2 a u_3' t^5 + (u_3')^2 t^6$. Modulo $t^4$ (since $t^4 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^4)$?), Actually $S_4 = \Spec(k[t]/(t^4))$, so $t^4 = 0$ in $k[t]/(t^4)$. So $t^4$ is zero. So $u_4^2 = a^2 t^4 + 2 a u_3' t^5 + (u_3')^2 t^6$. Since $t^4 = 0$, the first term is zero. The second term $2 a u_3' t^5$ is also zero because $t^5$ is multiple of $t^4$, so it's zero. So $u_4^2 = 0$ automatically for $n=3$? Wait, we need to be careful: In $k[t]/(t^4)$, $t^4 = 0$, so $t^5 = t \cdot t^4 = 0$, $t^6 = 0$. So indeed $u_4^2 = 0$ for any $a, u_3'$. Similarly $v_4^2 = 0$, $u_4 v_4 = a b t^4 + (a v_3' + b u_3') t^5 + ... = 0$ modulo $t^4$. So the obstruction to extending $u_3, v_3$ to $u_4, v_4$ is trivial: there is always a lift. So for $n=3$, the obstruction class is zero for any $a,b$. But earlier we said the obstruction class is $(a^2, b^2, a b)$ in $V$, but maybe we need to compute it correctly: The obstruction class is the failure of the relations $u^2 = uv = v^2 = 0$ to hold in $k[t]/(t^{n+1})$. For $n=3$, $u_3^2 = a^2 t^4 = 0$ modulo $t^4$, so no obstruction. So the obstruction class is zero. But earlier we thought for $n=2$, the obstruction class is $(a^2, b^2, a b)$. For $n=3$, perhaps the obstruction class is also $(a^2, b^2, a b)$ but with $a,b$ being the coefficients of $t^{n-1}$? Let's examine more systematically.

The obstruction class for extending a morphism $S_n \to X$ to $S_{n+1}$ is given by the class of the triple $(u_n^2, v_n^2, u_n v_n)$ in $V \otimes (t^n)/(t^{n+1})$. Since $u_n^2$, $v_n^2$, $u_n v_n$ are all multiples of $t^n$ (since they vanish modulo $t^n$ by assumption), they can be written as $c_1 t^n$, $c_2 t^n$, $c_3 t^n$, where $c_i \in k$. Then the obstruction class is $(c_1, c_2, c_3) \in V$ (identifying $V \otimes (t^n)/(t^{n+1}) \cong V$ via the basis $t^n$). So we need to compute $c_i = $ coefficient of $t^n$ in $u_n^2$, $v_n^2$, $u_n v_n$.

Thus for each $n$, we need to compute the triple $(c_1, c_2, c_3)$ for all possible $u_n, v_n$ satisfying $u_n^2 = u_n v_n = v_n^2 = 0$ modulo $t^n$.

Thus the set of obstruction classes for all $n$ is the union over $n$ of the sets $O_n = \{ (c_1, c_2, c_3) \mid \exists u_n, v_n \in (t) \subset k[t]/(t^n) \text{ satisfying } u_n^2 = u_n v_n = v_n^2 = 0 \mod t^n, \text{ and } c_i = [t^n] (u_n^2), [t^n] (v_n^2), [t^n] (u_n v_n) \}$.

Thus we need to compute $O_n$ for all $n$. The union $O = \bigcup_{n \ge 1} O_n$ is the set of all possible obstruction classes.

We can try to compute $O_n$ for each $n$ and see if they converge to some set. For $n=1$, $S_1 = \Spec(k)$, there is no obstruction (the triple is trivial). For $n=2$, we have $u_2 = a t$, $v_2 = b t$, and $u_2^2 = a^2 t^2$, $v_2^2 = b^2 t^2$, $u_2 v_2 = a b t^2$, so $c_1 = a^2$, $c_2 = b^2$, $c_3 = a b$. So $O_2 = \{ (a^2, b^2, a b) \mid a,b \in k \}$.

For $n=3$, we have $u_3 = a t^2$, $v_3 = b t^2$, but we also could have $u_3 = u_1 t + u_2 t^2$, $v_3 = v_1 t + v_2 t^2$ with $u_1^2 = 0$, $v_1^2 = 0$, $u_1 v_1 = 0$ (since $u_1, v_1$ must be zero). So $u_3 = u_2 t^2$, $v_3 = v_2 t^2$. So the only possible $u_3$ are multiples of $t^2$. Then $u_3^2 = (u_2 t^2)^2 = u_2^2 t^4 = 0$ modulo $t^3$, so $c_1 = 0$, $c_2 = 0$, $c_3 = 0$. So $O_3 = \{ (0,0,0) \}$.

Thus for $n \ge 3$, we might have $O_n = \{ (0,0,0) \}$ as well? Let's check $n=4$. For $n=4$, $S_4 = \Spec(k[t]/(t^4))$. The condition $u_4^2 = u_4 v_4 = v_4^2 = 0$ modulo $t^4$ imposes constraints: $u_4 = u_1 t + u_2 t^2 + u_3 t^3$. Then $u_4^2 = u_1^2 t^2 + 2 u_1 u_2 t^3 + (2 u_1 u_3 + u_2^2) t^4 + \dots$ Actually compute $u_4^2$ modulo $t^4$:

$u_4^2 = (u_1 t + u_2 t^2 + u_3 t^3)^2 = u_1^2 t^2 + 2 u_1 u_2 t^3 + (2 u_1 u_3 + u_2^2) t^4 + 2 u_2 u_3 t^5 + u_3^2 t^6$.

Modulo $t^4$, we keep terms up to $t^3$ only: $u_4^2 \equiv u_1^2 t^2 + 2 u_1 u_2 t^3 \mod t^4$. So $u_4^2$ is a linear combination of $t^2$ and $t^3$. The condition $u_4^2 = 0$ modulo $t^4$ means that the coefficients of $t^2$ and $t^3$ must be zero. So we need $u_1^2 = 0$ and $2 u_1 u_2 = 0$.

Similarly $v_4^2 = v_1^2 t^2 + 2 v_1 v_2 t^3 + \dots$, so $v_1^2 = 0$, $2 v_1 v_2 = 0$.

And $u_4 v_4 = (u_1 t + u_2 t^2 + u_3 t^3)(v_1 t + v_2 t^2 + v_3 t^3) = u_1 v_1 t^2 + (u_1 v_2 + u_2 v_1) t^3 + \dots$, so we need $u_1 v_1 = 0$, $u_1 v_2 + u_2 v_1 = 0$.

Thus the constraints are:

- $u_1^2 = 0$, $v_1^2 = 0$, $u_1 v_1 = 0$.
- $2 u_1 u_2 = 0$, $2 v_1 v_2 = 0$, $u_1 v_2 + u_2 v_1 = 0$.

Since $k$ is a field, the only nilpotent element is zero, so $u_1 = v_1 = 0$. Then the second set of constraints become $0 = 0$, so no constraints on $u_2, v_2, u_3, v_3$.

Thus for $n=4$, any $u_4, v_4$ of the form $u_4 = u_2 t^2 + u_3 t^3$, $v_4 = v_2 t^2 + v_3 t^3$ satisfy $u_4^2 = v_4^2 = u_4 v_4 = 0$ modulo $t^4$. So $u_4$ and $v_4$ have no $t$-term, only $t^2$ and $t^3$ terms. Then the obstruction class for extending to $S_5$ is given by the coefficient of $t^4$ in $u_4^2$, $v_4^2$, $u_4 v_4$.

Compute $u_4^2 = (u_2 t^2 + u_3 t^3)^2 = u_2^2 t^4 + 2 u_2 u_3 t^5 + u_3^2 t^6$. Modulo $t^5$? Actually we need the coefficient of $t^4$ in $u_4^2$, which is $u_2^2$. So $c_1 = u_2^2$. Similarly $c_2 = v_2^2$, $c_3 = u_2 v_2$. So $O_4 = \{ (u_2^2, v_2^2, u_2 v_2) \mid u_2, v_2 \in k \} = O_2$.

Thus $O_4$ is the same as $O_2$. So for $n=4$, the obstruction classes are again all triples of squares and product.

For $n=5$, we can similarly find that $u_5$ and $v_5$ can have terms up to $t^4$, but the lowest possible term is $t^2$ again? Let's examine. For $n=5$, $S_5 = \Spec(k[t]/(t^5))$. The condition $u_5^2 = 0$ modulo $t^5$ imposes constraints on the coefficients of $t^2$, $t^3$, $t^4$ in $u_5$. We can systematically analyze the constraints for general $n$.

General situation: $u_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} u_i t^i$, $v_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} v_i t^i$, with $u_i, v_i \in k$. The condition $u_n^2 = 0$ modulo $t^n$ means that for each $m < n$, the coefficient of $t^m$ in $u_n^2$ must be zero. The coefficient of $t^m$ in $u_n^2$ is $\sum_{i+j=m} u_i u_j$, where $i,j \ge 1$, $i+j=m$, and we sum over all $i,j$ with $i+j=m$, with $i,j \le n-1$ (but $i,j \ge 1$). So the condition is:

For each $m = 2, 3, \dots, n-1$, $\sum_{i+j=m} u_i u_j = 0$.

Similarly for $v_n^2$, we have $\sum_{i+j=m} v_i v_j = 0$ for $2 \le m \le n-1$.

And for $u_n v_n$, we have $\sum_{i+j=m} u_i v_j = 0$ for $2 \le m \le n-1$.

Thus the coefficients $u_i$, $v_i$ must satisfy a set of quadratic equations.

Now the obstruction class $c_i$ is the coefficient of $t^n$ in $u_n^2$, $v_n^2$, $u_n v_n$, i.e., $c_1 = \sum_{i+j=n} u_i u_j$, $c_2 = \sum_{i+j=n} v_i v_j$, $c_3 = \sum_{i+j=n} u_i v_j$.

Thus the obstruction triple is $(c_1, c_2, c_3)$.

Thus the problem reduces to: For each $n$, find the set $O_n = \{ (\sum_{i+j=n} u_i u_j, \sum_{i+j=n} v_i v_j, \sum_{i+j=n} u_i v_j) \mid u_i, v_i \in k, \sum_{i+j=m} u_i u_j = 0, \sum_{i+j=m} v_i v_j = 0, \sum_{i+j=m} u_i v_j = 0 \text{ for } 2 \le m \le n-1 \}$.

We need to find the union $O = \bigcup_{n \ge 1} O_n$.

We can attempt to characterize $O$ in terms of the structure of $V$.

Observation: For $n=2$, $O_2 = \{ (a^2, b^2, a b) \mid a,b \in k \}$. This is the image of the map $k^2 \to k^3$, $(a,b) \mapsto (a^2, b^2, a b)$. This is the set of triples $(p,q,r)$ such that $p q = r^2$, i.e., the quadratic cone. Indeed $(a^2)(b^2) = (a b)^2$. So $O_2 = \{ (p,q,r) \in k^3 \mid p q = r^2 \}$. This includes the case $p = q = r = 0$ (when $a = 0$ or $b = 0$). Also includes $p = a^2$, $q = b^2$, $r = a b$.

For $n=4$, we also found $O_4 = O_2$, i.e., the same set. For $n=6$, we might also get $O_6 = O_2$, etc. For odd $n$, $O_n = \{0\}$? Let's test $n=3$ we got $O_3 = \{0\}$. For $n=5$, maybe also $O_5 = \{0\}$? Let's check.

General pattern: For odd $n$, $O_n = \{0\}$. For even $n$, $O_n = O_2$. Let's test $n=6$.

We can try to compute $O_6$ using the constraints. For $n=6$, the constraints are for $m = 2,3,4,5$. The coefficients $u_i$, $v_i$ for $i=1,\dots,5$ must satisfy:

- For $m=2$: $u_1^2 = 0$, $v_1^2 = 0$, $u_1 v_1 = 0$.
- For $m=3$: $2 u_1 u_2 = 0$, $2 v_1 v_2 = 0$, $u_1 v_2 + u_2 v_1 = 0$.
- For $m=4$: $u_2^2 + 2 u_1 u_3 = 0$, $v_2^2 + 2 v_1 v_3 = 0$, $u_2 v_2 + u_1 v_3 + u_3 v_1 = 0$.
- For $m=5$: $2 u_2 u_3 + 2 u_1 u_4 = 0$, $2 v_2 v_3 + 2 v_1 v_4 = 0$, $u_2 v_3 + u_3 v_2 + u_1 v_4 + u_4 v_1 = 0$.

Now we need to find all possible $c_1 = \sum_{i+j=6} u_i u_j$, $c_2 = \sum_{i+j=6} v_i v_j$, $c_3 = \sum_{i+j=6} u_i v_j$.

Since $i,j \ge 1$, $i+j=6$ yields pairs $(1,5)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,2)$, $(5,1)$. So $c_1 = u_1 u_5 + u_2 u_4 + u_3^2 + u_4 u_2 + u_5 u_1 = 2 u_1 u_5 + 2 u_2 u_4 + u_3^2$. Similarly $c_2 = 2 v_1 v_5 + 2 v_2 v_4 + v_3^2$, $c_3 = u_1 v_5 + u_2 v_4 + u_3 v_3 + u_4 v_2 + u_5 v_1 = u_1 v_5 + u_2 v_4 + u_3 v_3 + u_4 v_2 + u_5 v_1$.

Now, from $m=2$, $u_1^2 = 0$, $v_1^2 = 0$, $u_1 v_1 = 0$, so $u_1 = v_1 = 0$ (since $k$ is a field). So $u_1 = v_1 = 0$.

Then $m=3$ constraints become $0 = 0$, no constraints.

$m=4$ constraints become $u_2^2 + 2 u_1 u_3 = u_2^2 = 0$, $v_2^2 = 0$, $u_2 v_2 = 0$. So $u_2^2 = 0$, $v_2^2 = 0$, $u_2 v_2 = 0$. Since $k$ is a field, $u_2 = v_2 = 0$.

Thus $u_2 = v_2 = 0$.

Then $m=5$ constraints become $2 u_2 u_3 + 2 u_1 u_4 = 0$, which is automatically satisfied. Similarly for $v$.

Thus $u_2 = v_2 = 0$, $u_1 = v_1 = 0$, leaving $u_3, u_4, u_5$ and $v_3, v_4, v_5$ unrestricted? Let's see: For $m=4$, we used $u_2^2 = 0$ and $v_2^2 = 0$, $u_2 v_2 = 0$, but $u_3$ didn't appear. For $m=5$, $u_3$ appears only in $2 u_2 u_3 + 2 u_1 u_4 = 0$, which is automatically satisfied because $u_1 = u_2 = 0$. Similarly for $v_3$. So $u_3$, $v_3$, $u_4$, $v_4$, $u_5$, $v_5$ are free.

Now compute $c_1 = 2 u_1 u_5 + 2 u_2 u_4 + u_3^2 = u_3^2$ (since $u_1 = u_2 = 0$). So $c_1 = u_3^2$. Similarly $c_2 = v_3^2$, $c_3 = u_3 v_3$. So $O_6 = \{ (u_3^2, v_3^2, u_3 v_3) \mid u_3, v_3 \in k \} = O_2$.

Thus for even $n$, $O_n = O_2$. For odd $n$, $O_n = \{0\}$? Let's test $n=5$.

For $n=5$, constraints for $m=2,3,4$:

- $m=2$: $u_1^2 = 0$, $v_1^2 = 0$, $u_1 v_1 = 0$, so $u_1 = v_1 = 0$.

- $m=3$: $2 u_1 u_2 = 0$, $2 v_1 v_2 = 0$, $u_1 v_2 + u_2 v_1 = 0$, automatically satisfied.

- $m=4$: $u_2^2 + 2 u_1 u_3 = u_2^2 = 0$, $v_2^2 = 0$, $u_2 v_2 = 0$, so $u_2 = v_2 = 0$.

Thus $u_1 = u_2 = 0$, $v_1 = v_2 = 0$. Then $u_3$, $v_3$, $u_4$, $v_4$ are free? Let's check $m=4$ also includes $2 u_1 u_3 = 0$, which is satisfied. So $u_3$, $v_3$, $u_4$, $v_4$ free.

Now compute $c_1 = \sum_{i+j=5} u_i u_j = u_1 u_4 + u_2 u_3 + u_3 u_2 + u_4 u_1 = 0$ because $u_1 = u_2 = 0$. So $c_1 = 0$. Similarly $c_2 = 0$, $c_3 = u_1 v_4 + u_2 v_3 + u_3 v_2 + u_4 v_1 = 0$. So $c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = 0$. So $O_5 = \{0\}$.

Thus for odd $n$, $O_n = \{0\}$. For even $n$, $O_n = O_2$.

Thus the union $O = O_2 \cup \{0\} = O_2$ (since $0$ is already in $O_2$ when $a=0$ or $b=0$). So $O = O_2 = \{ (p,q,r) \in k^3 \mid p q = r^2 \}$.

Thus the set of all possible obstruction classes is the quadratic cone $p q = r^2$ in $V \cong k^3$.

But we need to check if there are any other possible obstruction classes that could arise for other $n$ beyond even $n$? The pattern suggests that for any even $n$, the obstruction classes are exactly $O_2$. For odd $n$, only zero. So the union is $O_2$.

Thus the answer: The obstruction classes that appear are precisely those triples $(a^2, b^2, a b) \in V$, i.e., the image of the map $k^2 \to V$, $(a,b) \mapsto a^2 \cdot \alpha_{x^2} + b^2 \cdot \alpha_{y^2} + a b \cdot \alpha_{xy}$, where $\alpha_{x^2}, \alpha_{y^2}, \alpha_{xy}$ is the dual basis of $V$ to $x^2, xy, y^2$. In other words, the obstruction classes are exactly those elements $v \in V$ such that $v$ lies on the quadratic cone defined by $p q = r^2$, where $(p,q,r)$ are the coordinates of $v$ with respect to the dual basis of $x^2, xy, y^2$.

Alternatively, we can describe $V$ as $\operatorname{Hom}_k(\mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3, k)$, which is spanned by the linear functionals $\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3$ dual to $x^2, xy, y^2$. Then the obstruction classes are the elements $a^2 \ell_1 + b^2 \ell_2 + a b \ell_3$, for all $a,b \in k$. So $V$ is a 3-dimensional vector space over $k$, and the obstruction classes form the quadratic cone $Q = \{ a^2 \ell_1 + b^2 \ell_2 + a b \ell_3 \mid a,b \in k \}$.

Thus the answer: All elements of $V$ that are of the form $a^2 \cdot [x^2]^* + b^2 \cdot [y^2]^* + a b \cdot [xy]^*$ for some $a,b \in k$.

But we should verify that there are no other obstruction classes that could appear for some $n$ beyond those of the form $(a^2, b^2, a b)$. Could there be some obstruction class that is not on the cone but appears for some $n$? Let's think about the structure more generally.

We can try to find all possible triples $(c_1,c_2,c_3)$ that can appear as $c_i = \sum_{i+j=n} u_i u_j$, etc., given the constraints that $u_i, v_i$ satisfy the earlier constraints. For odd $n$, we saw that $c_i = 0$ always. For even $n$, we saw that $c_i = (u_{n/2})^2$, $(v_{n/2})^2$, $u_{n/2} v_{n/2}$, provided all lower-degree coefficients vanish. Indeed, we saw that for $n=2$, $u_1$ and $v_1$ are free, and $c_i = u_1^2$, $v_1^2$, $u_1 v_1$. For $n=4$, we saw that $u_1 = v_1 = 0$, $u_2$ and $v_2$ are free, and $c_i = u_2^2$, $v_2^2$, $u_2 v_2$. For $n=6$, we saw that $u_1 = v_1 = 0$, $u_2 = v_2 = 0$, $u_3$ and $v_3$ are free, and $c_i = u_3^2$, $v_3^2$, $u_3 v_3$. So for even $n$, $c_i = u_{n/2}^2$, $v_{n/2}^2$, $u_{n/2} v_{n/2}$, and all other $u_i$, $v_i$ for $i < n/2$ must be zero. So indeed $O_n = O_2$ for all even $n$. For odd $n$, $c_i = 0$.

Thus the union $O = O_2$. So the answer is the quadratic cone.

Thus the answer: All elements $v \in V$ of the form $v = a^2 \cdot \phi_{x^2} + b^2 \cdot \phi_{y^2} + a b \cdot \phi_{xy}$ for some $a,b \in k$.

We can phrase this as: The obstruction classes are exactly those $v \in V$ such that $v$ lies in the image of the map $S^2(k^2) \to V$ given by $(a,b) \mapsto a^2 \cdot [x^2]^* + b^2 \cdot [y^2]^* + a b \cdot [xy]^*$.

Alternatively, we can describe $V$ as $k^3$ with coordinates $(p,q,r)$ corresponding to $[x^2]^*$, $[xy]^*$, $[y^2]^*$ (or any ordering). Then the obstruction classes are those $(p,q,r)$ satisfying $p q = r^2$.

Thus the answer: The set of all obstruction classes is the quadratic cone $Q = \{ (p,q,r) \in k^3 \mid p q = r^2 \}$.

Now we need to provide a thorough solution, explaining the reasoning and verifying that the answer is independent of the choice of basis for $(t^k)/(t^{k+1})$. Also we should mention that the obstruction theory yields a class in $V \otimes (t^k)/(t^{k+1})$, and after identifying $(t^k)/(t^{k+1}) \cong k$ via the basis $t^k$, we get a class in $V$. The natural basis is $t^k$, which yields the identification.

We should also discuss the canonical obstruction theory for the local ring $R = k[[x,y]]/(x^2, xy, y^2)$, and the relationship between $V$ and the deformation theory.

Thus the answer: The obstruction classes are exactly the elements $a^2 \cdot \alpha_{x^2} + b^2 \cdot \alpha_{y^2} + a b \cdot \alpha_{xy} \in V$, where $\alpha_{x^2}, \alpha_{y^2}, \alpha_{xy}$ is the basis of $V$ dual to $x^2, xy, y^2$.

Alternatively, we can write $V = \operatorname{Hom}_k(\mathfrak{m}^2 / \mathfrak{m}^3, k) = \operatorname{Hom}_k(k[x,y]_2, k)$, where $k[x,y]_2$ is the degree 2 part of the polynomial ring. Then $V$ is isomorphic to $k^3$, with basis dual to $x^2, xy, y^2$. The obstruction classes are those linear forms $\ell \in V$ that can be expressed as $\ell = a^2 \cdot \ell_{x^2} + b^2 \cdot \ell_{y^2} + a b \cdot \ell_{xy}$ for some $a,b \in k$. This is the image of the map $k^2 \to V$, $(a,b) \mapsto a^2 \ell_{x^2} + b^2 \ell_{y^2} + a b \ell_{xy}$. The image is a quadratic cone $Q \subset V$, defined by $p q = r^2$ in coordinates $(p,q,r)$ corresponding to $\ell_{x^2}, \ell_{y^2}, \ell_{xy}$.

Thus the answer: All elements of $V$ lying on the quadratic cone $Q = \{ v \in V \mid v \text{ can be written as } a^2 \cdot \ell_{x^2} + b^2 \cdot \ell_{y^2} + a b \cdot \ell_{xy} \text{ for some } a,b \in k \}$.

Now we need to provide a clear solution.

We need to set up the extension problem. Let $A_n = k[t]/(t^n)$. The map $A_n \to X$ corresponds to a $k$-algebra homomorphism $\phi_n: R \to A_n$, where $R = k[[x,y]]/(x^2, xy, y^2)$. Since $R = k \oplus \mathfrak{m}_R$, with $\mathfrak{m}_R^2 = 0$, such a homomorphism is determined by the images $u_n = \phi_n(x)$, $v_n = \phi_n(y) \in \mathfrak{m}_{A_n} = (t)$. The condition $x^2 = xy = y^2 = 0$ in $R$ translates to $u_n^2 = u_n v_n = v_n^2 = 0$ in $A_n$.

Thus a morphism $S_n \to X$ corresponds to a pair $(u_n, v_n) \in (t) \subset A_n$ satisfying $u_n^2 = u_n v_n = v_n^2 = 0$. The obstruction to extending $(u_n, v_n)$ to $A_{n+1}$ is the element $c = (c_1, c_2, c_3) \in V$ defined by $c_1 = [t^n] u_n^2$, $c_2 = [t^n] v_n^2$, $c_3 = [t^n] u_n v_n$, where $[t^n]$ denotes the coefficient of $t^n$. Indeed $u_n^2$, $v_n^2$, $u_n v_n$ are all multiples of $t^n$, because they vanish modulo $t^n$.

Now we need to find all possible triples $(c_1, c_2, c_3)$ that can arise as $([t^n] u_n^2, [t^n] v_n^2, [t^n] u_n v_n)$ for some $n$ and some $(u_n, v_n)$ satisfying the relations.

We can solve the constraints for $u_n$ and $v_n$ as we did above.

One approach: Write $u_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} u_i t^i$, $v_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} v_i t^i$. The condition $u_n^2 = 0$ modulo $t^n$ yields the system of equations $\sum_{i+j=m} u_i u_j = 0$ for $2 \le m \le n-1$, and similarly for $v_n$, and $\sum_{i+j=m} u_i v_j = 0$ for $2 \le m \le n-1$.

Now we can analyze this system. We can show by induction that for odd $n$, the only solution is $u_i = v_i = 0$ for all $i$, while for even $n$, the only non-zero coefficients can be $u_{n/2}$ and $v_{n/2}$, which can be arbitrary. This yields the obstruction triple $(u_{n/2}^2, v_{n/2}^2, u_{n/2} v_{n/2})$. This is exactly the image of the map $k^2 \to V$, $(a,b) \mapsto (a^2, b^2, a b)$. Therefore the set of all obstruction classes is the quadratic cone $Q \subset V$.

Alternatively, we can argue more conceptually: The deformation functor of $X$ is isomorphic to the functor of Artin rings $\operatorname{Def}_X$ which is pro-representable by the complete local ring $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_{\operatorname{Def}_X} \cong k[[a,b]]/(a^2 b^2 - a^2 b^2?)$? Actually the tangent space is $\operatorname{Hom}_k(\mathfrak{m}_R / \mathfrak{m}_R^2, k) = \operatorname{Hom}_k(\mathfrak{m}_R, k) \cong k^2$, and the obstruction space is $V = \operatorname{Hom}_k(\mathfrak{m}_R^2 / \mathfrak{m}_R^3, k) \cong k^3$. The obstruction map for the extension $A_{n+1} \to A_n$ is given by a quadratic form on the tangent space. In this case, the obstruction map is the map $k^2 \to V$ given by $(a,b) \mapsto a^2 \ell_{x^2} + b^2 \ell_{y^2} + a b \ell_{xy}$. This is the map that sends a first-order deformation (determined by $a,b$) to its obstruction to extending to the next order. This map is quadratic because the obstruction is quadratic in the deformation parameters.

Thus the set of obstruction classes that appear for the special extension problems (where the deformation parameter $t$ is a formal parameter controlling the thickening of the point) is exactly the image of this quadratic map, which is the quadratic cone $Q$.

Thus the answer: All elements of $V$ of the form $a^2 \cdot [x^2]^* + b^2 \cdot [y^2]^* + a b \cdot [xy]^*$ for some $a,b \in k$.

Now we need to write the answer clearly, with proper notation and explanation.

We can also note that $V$ is isomorphic to $k^3$ via the basis dual to $x^2, xy, y^2$. Then the obstruction classes are precisely those triples $(p,q,r) \in k^3$ satisfying $p q = r^2$. This is a quadratic cone (a quadric surface) in $V$.

Thus the answer: The obstruction classes that appear are exactly the elements of $V$ lying on the quadric cone $p q = r^2$.

Now we should produce a final answer that includes the reasoning, the identification of $V$, the description of the obstruction classes, and the verification that the answer is independent of the basis choice.

We should also note that the obstruction classes for $n=1$ are trivial (zero), for $n=2$ are the full cone, for $n=3$ only zero, for $n=4$ again the cone, etc. So the union is the cone.

We should also mention that the canonical obstruction theory for the local ring $R$ yields an obstruction class in $V$ for each infinitesimal extension $A_{n+1} \to A_n$, and the special extension problems considered correspond to deformations of the inclusion of the origin along the $t$-direction. The obstruction map for these deformations is given by the quadratic form $(a,b) \mapsto (a^2, b^2, a b)$. Thus the set of obstruction classes is the image of this map.

Now we need to produce the final answer.

We should also discuss the independence of basis: The identification $V \otimes (t^k)/(t^{k+1}) \cong V$ is via the natural basis $t^k$, but any basis would give a linear isomorphism $V \otimes (t^k)/(t^{k+1}) \cong V$, and the image of the obstruction class in $V$ would be scaled accordingly. However, the set of obstruction classes as a subset of $V$ is independent of the choice because the map $V \otimes (t^k)/(t^{k+1}) \to V$ is linear and the identification is just a linear isomorphism; the set of
