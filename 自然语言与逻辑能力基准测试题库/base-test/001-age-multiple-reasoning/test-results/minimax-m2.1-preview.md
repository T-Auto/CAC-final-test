The user asks a simple arithmetic problem in Chinese: Father is 45 this year, son is 15. How many years ago was the father's age 4 times the son's age? So we set up: (45 - x) = 4 * (15 - x). Solve: 45 - x = 60 - 4x => bring terms: -x + 4x = 60 - 45 => 3x = 15 => x = 5. So 5 years ago.

But double-check: 5 years ago father was 40, son was 10, indeed 40 = 4 * 10.

Thus answer: 5 years ago.

We need to answer in Chinese. The problem is simple, the answer is 5 years.

We should also show the solution process.

Thus answer: 5年前。

Thus I can output: 5年前父亲的年龄是儿子的4倍.

We can also show equation.

Thus final answer: 5年前.

设 \(x\) 年前父亲的年龄是儿子的 4 倍，则：

\[
45 - x = 4\,(15 - x)
\]

展开并求解：

\[
45 - x = 60 - 4x \\
- x + 4x = 60 - 45 \\
3x = 15 \\
x = 5
\]

**答案：5 年前**，父亲 40 岁，儿子 10 岁，父亲的年龄正好是儿子的 4 倍。
