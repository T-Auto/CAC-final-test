Provide a detailed exposition on the classification of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$. Your response should be comprehensive and structured into the following four parts:

**Part 1: Overview of the Classification**
Present a concise summary of the main classification theorem for the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$. Your overview should state the fundamental principle governing this classification, correcting any common misconceptions, and introduce the key mathematical objects that label the isomorphism classes of these representations.

**Part 2: The Structure of the Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$**
Describe the fundamental structural properties of the complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$. Begin by stating its rank and dimension. Proceed to define its root system, including the number of roots. Specify a conventional choice for the simple roots, $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, and the inner products among them based on a standard normalization. Conclude this part by deriving the Cartan matrix of $\mathfrak{g}_2$.

**Part 3: The Theorem of the Highest Weight**
Explain the role of the Theorem of the Highest Weight in this classification. Define the necessary concepts, including weight, weight space, highest weight, integral weight, and dominant integral weight. State the precise one-to-one correspondence that forms the core of the classification theorem for $\mathfrak{g}_2$. Finally, explain how the complete set of dominant integral weights for $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is constructed.

**Part 4: The Fundamental Representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$**
Identify the fundamental representations that serve as the basic building blocks for all finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$. For each fundamental representation, specify its corresponding highest weight, its dimension, and its common name and physical or mathematical realization. Elaborate on their significance in generating the entire spectrum of irreducible representations.
