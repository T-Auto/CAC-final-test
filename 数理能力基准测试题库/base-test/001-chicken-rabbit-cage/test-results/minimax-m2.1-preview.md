The user asks: "鸡兔同笼，共35只头，94只脚，问鸡兔各多少？" This is a classic Chinese puzzle: chickens and rabbits in a cage, total heads = 35, total feet = 94. We need to solve for the number of chickens (鸡) and rabbits (兔). Let x = number of chickens, y = number of rabbits. Then x + y = 35 (heads). Chickens have 2 feet, rabbits have 4 feet, total feet: 2x + 4y = 94. Solve: from x + y = 35 => x = 35 - y. Plug into feet: 2(35 - y) + 4y = 94 => 70 - 2y + 4y = 94 => 70 + 2y = 94 => 2y = 24 => y = 12. Then x = 35 - 12 = 23. So 23 chickens, 12 rabbits.

But the user asks "请给出完整的解题过程和最终答案。" So we need to provide a complete solution with steps, possibly also alternative methods (like using equations, substitution, elimination). Provide answer: 23 chickens, 12 rabbits.

Thus we need to respond in Chinese, with a clear step-by-step solution, possibly including the logic and verification.

Thus answer: 23 chickens, 12 rabbits.

We can also show the method using linear equations, or using the concept that each rabbit has 2 more feet than a chicken, so if all were chickens, there would be 35*2=70 feet, but we have 94, so extra 24 feet, each extra 2 feet corresponds to a rabbit, so there are 24/2=12 rabbits, then chickens = 35-12=23.

Thus answer: 鸡 23只，兔 12只。

We can also mention that the solution is unique.

Thus answer in Chinese, with clear steps.

Given the user request is straightforward, we can respond.

We must produce final answer in Chinese.

Thus answer:

**解题过程**:

1. 设鸡的数量为 x，兔的数量为 y。
2. 根据头数：x + y = 35。
3. 根据脚数：2x + 4y = 94。
4. 消去法：把第一式乘以2得 2x + 2y = 70，减去第二式： (2x + 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 94 - 70 → 2y = 24 → y = 12。
5. 代入 x + y = 35：x = 35 - 12 = 23。

**检验**：23 只鸡有 46 只脚，12 只兔有 48 只脚，合计 94 只脚，符合题意。

**答案**：鸡 23 只，兔 12 只。

Thus answer.

Now produce final.

**解题过程**

设鸡的只数为 \(x\)，兔的只数为 \(y\)。  
根据题意可以得到两个方程：

1. **头数方程**（每只动物有 1 个头）  
   \[
   x + y = 35
   \]

2. **脚数方程**（鸡有 2 只脚，兔有 4 只脚）  
   \[
   2x + 4y = 94
   \]

---

**解方程组**

先消去 \(x\)：

把第一式乘以 2 得到  
\[
2x + 2y = 70
\]

用脚数方程减去上面的等式：

\[
\begin{aligned}
(2x + 4y) - (2x + 2y) &= 94 - 70 \\
2y &= 24 \\
y &= 12
\end{aligned}
\]

把 \(y = 12\) 代回头数方程：

\[
x + 12 = 35 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad x = 35 - 12 = 23
\]

---

**检验**

- 鸡 23 只 → 脚数 \(23 \times 2 = 46\) 只  
- 兔 12 只 → 脚数 \(12 \times 4 = 48\) 只  

总脚数 \(46 + 48 = 94\) 只，满足题意。

**答案**

- **鸡 23 只**  
- **兔 12 只**
