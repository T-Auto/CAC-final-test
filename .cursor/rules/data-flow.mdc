# Data-Flow

## Core Component Interactions

### RCS Calculation Flow
- Physical optics (PO) calculation module receives geometric model data
- Processes surface normals and incident angles
- Outputs RCS values to optimization component
- Path: `calculateRCS_PO.m`
Importance Score: 90

### Optimization Data Pipeline
- Receives RCS calculation results
- Processes geometric constraints and aerodynamic requirements
- Generates modified geometry parameters
- Feeds updated models back to RCS calculator
- Path: `stealth_optimizer.m`
Importance Score: 85

### Geometric Modeling Flow
- Receives optimization parameters
- Generates stealth fighter surface models
- Outputs facet-based geometry to RCS calculator
- Path: `main.m`
Importance Score: 80
