# Classification of Finite-Dimensional Irreducible Representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$

## Part 1: Overview of the Classification

The classification of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the exceptional simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is a special case of the general classification theorem for semisimple Lie algebras, first established by Élie Cartan and Hermann Weyl. The fundamental principle governing this classification is that every finite-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is uniquely determined by its highest weight—a linear functional on the Cartan subalgebra satisfying integrality and dominance conditions—and conversely, every dominant integral highest weight corresponds to exactly one such representation (up to isomorphism).

### Key Clarifications of Common Misconceptions:
1.  **Not all integral weights correspond to irreps**: Only dominant integral weights (those non-negatively paired with coroots) label irreducible representations. Arbitrary integral weights do not generally correspond to finite-dimensional irreps.
2.  **Highest weight uniqueness**: Each irreducible representation has a unique highest weight (up to isomorphism), which serves as a complete invariant. No two non-isomorphic irreps share the same highest weight.
3.  **Root system sufficiency**: For $\mathfrak{g}_2$, the classification depends solely on its root system (type $G_2$), requiring no additional algebraic structure beyond the Lie algebra itself.

The core objects of the classification are dominant integral highest weights, which form a countable set of linear functionals on the Cartan subalgebra. These weights bijectively label the isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{g}_2$-representations.

## Part 2: The Structure of the Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$

$\mathfrak{g}_2$ is the smallest exceptional simple Lie algebra over $\mathbb{C}$. Its structural properties are defined by its rank, dimension, root system, and Cartan matrix:

### Rank and Dimension
- **Rank**: The rank of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is 2, meaning it contains a 2-dimensional abelian Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$.
- **Dimension**: $\dim(\mathfrak{g}_2) = 14$, which is the sum of the rank (2) and the number of roots (12).

### Root System of Type $G_2$
The root system $\Phi$ of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is the exceptional root system of type $G_2$, characterized by two distinct root lengths:
- **Long roots**: Squared length $(\alpha, \alpha) = 2$ (standard normalization).
- **Short roots**: Squared length $(\alpha, \alpha) = 2/3$, with the ratio of squared lengths of long to short roots equal to 3.

The root system contains 12 roots total: 6 positive roots and 6 negative roots. The angle between a long and short root is $150^\circ$, with $\cos(150^\circ) = -\sqrt{3}/2$.

### Conventional Simple Roots
A standard choice of simple roots (generators of the positive root system) is:
- $\alpha_1$: The short simple root, with $(\alpha_1, \alpha_1) = 2/3$.
- $\alpha_2$: The long simple root, with $(\alpha_2, \alpha_2) = 2$.

Their inner product is:
$$(\alpha_1, \alpha_2) = \|\alpha_1\| \|\alpha_2\| \cos(150^\circ) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -1.$$

The positive roots of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ are generated by adding simple roots:
$$\Phi^+ = \{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_1+\alpha_2, 2\alpha_1+\alpha_2, 3\alpha_1+\alpha_2, 3\alpha_1+2\alpha_2\}.$$

### Cartan Matrix
The Cartan matrix $A = (A_{ij})$ is defined by $A_{ij} = 2(\alpha_i, \alpha_j)/(\alpha_i, \alpha_i)$, where $\alpha_i^\vee = 2\alpha_i/(\alpha_i, \alpha_i)$ are the simple coroots. For $\mathfrak{g}_2$:
- $A_{11} = 2(\alpha_1, \alpha_1)/(\alpha_1, \alpha_1) = 2$,
- $A_{12} = 2(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)/(\alpha_1, \alpha_1) = 2(-1)/(2/3) = -3$,
- $A_{21} = 2(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)/(\alpha_2, \alpha_2) = 2(-1)/2 = -1$,
- $A_{22} = 2(\alpha_2, \alpha_2)/(\alpha_2, \alpha_2) = 2$.

Thus, the Cartan matrix of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & -3 \\ -1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}.$$

The Dynkin diagram for $\mathfrak{g}_2$ consists of two nodes (representing $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$) connected by three edges, with an arrow pointing from the long root $\alpha_2$ to the short root $\alpha_1$ to indicate the root length ratio.

## Part 3: The Theorem of the Highest Weight

The Theorem of the Highest Weight is the cornerstone of the classification of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of semisimple Lie algebras, including $\mathfrak{g}_2$. We first define key concepts:

### Key Definitions
1.  **Weight**: For a representation $\pi: \mathfrak{g}_2 \to \mathfrak{gl}(V)$, a weight is a linear functional $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ (the dual of the Cartan subalgebra) such that the weight space $V_\lambda = \{v \in V \mid \pi(h)v = \lambda(h)v \text{ for all } h \in \mathfrak{h}\}$ is non-trivial. The dimension of $V_\lambda$ is the multiplicity of $\lambda$.
2.  **Highest Weight**: A weight $\lambda$ of $V$ is highest if for every positive root $\alpha$, $\lambda + \alpha$ is not a weight of $V$. Equivalently, the action of all positive root vectors $e_\alpha \in \mathfrak{g}_2$ annihilates the highest weight space $V_\lambda$.
3.  **Integral Weight**: A weight $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ is integral if it pairs integrally with all simple coroots: $(\lambda, \alpha_i^\vee) = 2(\lambda, \alpha_i)/(\alpha_i, \alpha_i) \in \mathbb{Z}$ for $i=1,2$.
4.  **Dominant Integral Weight**: An integral weight $\lambda$ is dominant if it pairs non-negatively with all simple coroots: $(\lambda, \alpha_i^\vee) \geq 0$ for $i=1,2$.

### Precise Classification Correspondence
For $\mathfrak{g}_2$, the Theorem of the Highest Weight states:
> There is a bijection between the set of isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ and the set of dominant integral weights of $\mathfrak{g}_2$.

Formally, for every dominant integral weight $\lambda$, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) finite-dimensional irreducible representation $V(\lambda)$ with highest weight $\lambda$, and every finite-dimensional irreducible representation is isomorphic to $V(\lambda)$ for exactly one dominant integral weight $\lambda$.

### Construction of Dominant Integral Weights
The set of dominant integral weights is constructed using fundamental weights $\{\omega_1, \omega_2\}$, defined by the dual condition with respect to simple coroots:
$$(\omega_i, \alpha_j^\vee) = \delta_{ij},$$
where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Explicitly:
- $\omega_1$: $(\omega_1, \alpha_1^\vee) = 1$, $(\omega_1, \alpha_2^\vee) = 0$. This implies $(\omega_1, \alpha_1) = 1/3$ and $(\omega_1, \alpha_2) = 0$.
- $\omega_2$: $(\omega_2, \alpha_1^\vee) = 0$, $(\omega_2, \alpha_2^\vee) = 1$. This implies $(\omega_2, \alpha_1) = 0$ and $(\omega_2, \alpha_2) = 1$.

Every dominant integral weight can be written uniquely as a non-negative integer linear combination of the fundamental weights:
$$\lambda = m_1\omega_1 + m_2\omega_2, \quad m_1, m_2 \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}.$$

The half-sum of positive roots $\rho = \omega_1 + \omega_2$ (a key object in the Weyl dimension and character formulas) plays a critical role in verifying integrality and dominance.

## Part 4: The Fundamental Representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$

The fundamental representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ are the irreducible representations corresponding to the fundamental weights $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. They are the "building blocks" of all finite-dimensional irreducible representations, as every such representation can be generated by tensor products of the fundamental representations and subsequent decomposition into irreducibles.

### First Fundamental Representation: $V(\omega_1)$
- **Highest Weight**: $\omega_1$.
- **Dimension**: 7 (computed via the Weyl dimension formula, as verified in the introduction to this section).
- **Common Name**: The 7-dimensional vector representation or imaginary octonion representation.
- **Realization**: $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is the automorphism group of the octonions (Cayley numbers), an 8-dimensional normed division algebra over $\mathbb{C}$. The purely imaginary octonions form a 7-dimensional vector space $\operatorname{Im}(\mathbb{O})$, and $\mathfrak{g}_2$ acts faithfully on $\operatorname{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ via automorphisms. This action defines the 7-dimensional fundamental representation. It is also realized as the space of vectors in the 7-dimensional Euclidean space equipped with a cross product, whose automorphism group is $\mathfrak{g}_2$.

### Second Fundamental Representation: $V(\omega_2)$
- **Highest Weight**: $\omega_2$.
- **Dimension**: 14 (equal to the dimension of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ itself).
- **Common Name**: The 14-dimensional adjoint representation.
- **Realization**: The adjoint representation is defined by the action of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ on itself via the Lie bracket: $\operatorname{ad}(x)y = [x, y]$ for $x, y \in \mathfrak{g}_2$. This representation is faithful, as $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is simple (hence has no non-trivial ideals). It can also be realized as the space of 3-forms on $\operatorname{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ invariant under the octonion cross product.

### Significance of Fundamental Representations
The fundamental representations generate the entire spectrum of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ through two key mechanisms:
1.  **Tensor Product Decomposition**: Every irreducible representation $V(m_1\omega_1 + m_2\omega_2)$ appears as a subrepresentation of the tensor product $V(\omega_1)^{\otimes m_1} \otimes V(\omega_2)^{\otimes m_2}$. For example, $V(\omega_1) \otimes V(\omega_1)$ decomposes into $V(0)$ (the trivial 1-dimensional representation) $\oplus V(2\omega_1) \oplus V(\omega_2) \oplus V(\omega_1)$, illustrating how new irreps are generated.
2.  **Polynomial Ring of Characters**: The ring of characters of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is a polynomial ring generated by the characters of $V(\omega_1)$ and $V(\omega_2)$. This means the character of any irreducible representation can be expressed as a polynomial in the characters of the fundamental representations, enabling systematic computation of representation properties.

In summary, the fundamental representations are the minimal non-trivial irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$, and their tensor products generate all other finite-dimensional irreducible representations via Clebsch-Gordan decomposition.</think_never_used_51bce0c785ca2f68081bfa7d91973934># Classification of Finite-Dimensional Irreducible Representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$

1.  **Integrality vs. Dominance**: Not all integral weights (those pairing integrally with coroots) correspond to irreducible representations. Only dominant integral weights (non-negatively paired with coroots) label irreps.
2.  **Highest Weight Uniqueness**: Each irreducible representation has a unique highest weight (up to isomorphism), which serves as a complete invariant. No two non-isomorphic irreps share the same highest weight.
3.  **Root System Sufficiency**: For $\mathfrak{g}_2$, the classification depends solely on its root system (type $G_2$), requiring no additional algebraic structure beyond the Lie algebra itself.

The classification reduces to a bijection between isomorphism classes of irreps and dominant integral highest weights, making these weights the primary labeling objects for $\mathfrak{g}_2$’s representation theory.

## Part 2: The Structure of the Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$

$\mathfrak{g}_2$ is the smallest exceptional simple Lie algebra over $\mathbb{C}$. Its structural properties are defined by its rank, dimension, root system, and Cartan matrix:

### Rank and Dimension
- **Rank**: The rank of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is 2, meaning it contains a 2-dimensional abelian Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$.
- **Dimension**: $\dim(\mathfrak{g}_2) = 14$, calculated as the sum of the rank (2) and the number of roots (12).

### Root System of Type $G_2$
The root system $\Phi$ of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is the exceptional root system of type $G_2$, distinguished by two root lengths:
- **Long roots**: Squared length $(\alpha, \alpha) = 2$ (standard normalization for simple Lie algebras).
- **Short roots**: Squared length $(\alpha, \alpha) = 2/3$, with the ratio of squared lengths of long to short roots equal to 3.

The root system contains 12 roots total (6 positive, 6 negative). The angle between a long and short root is $150^\circ$, with $\cos(150^\circ) = -\sqrt{3}/2$.

### Conventional Simple Roots
A standard choice of simple roots (generators of the positive root system) is:
- $\alpha_1$: The short simple root, with $(\alpha_1, \alpha_1) = 2/3$.
- $\alpha_2$: The long simple root, with $(\alpha_2, \alpha_2) = 2$.

Their inner product is:
$$(\alpha_1, \alpha_2) = \|\alpha_1\| \|\alpha_2\| \cos(150^\circ) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -1.$$

The positive roots generated by these simple roots are:
$$\Phi^+ = \{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_1+\alpha_2, 2\alpha_1+\alpha_2, 3\alpha_1+\alpha_2, 3\alpha_1+2\alpha_2\}.$$

### Cartan Matrix
The Cartan matrix $A = (A_{ij})$ encodes the inner product structure of the simple roots, defined by $A_{ij} = 2(\alpha_i, \alpha_j)/(\alpha_i, \alpha_i)$ (where $\alpha_i^\vee = 2\alpha_i/(\alpha_i, \alpha_i)$ are the simple coroots). For $\mathfrak{g}_2$:
- $A_{11} = 2(\alpha_1, \alpha_1)/(\alpha_1, \alpha_1) = 2$,
- $A_{12} = 2(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)/(\alpha_1, \alpha_1) = 2(-1)/(2/3) = -3$,
- $A_{21} = 2(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)/(\alpha_2, \alpha_2) = 2(-1)/2 = -1$,
- $A_{22} = 2(\alpha_2, \alpha_2)/(\alpha_2, \alpha_2) = 2$.

The Cartan matrix of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is thus:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & -3 \\ -1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}.$$

The Dynkin diagram for $\mathfrak{g}_2$ has two nodes (representing $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$) connected by three edges, with an arrow pointing from the long root $\alpha_2$ to the short root $\alpha_1$ to indicate the root length ratio.

## Part 3: The Theorem of the Highest Weight

The Theorem of the Highest Weight is the foundational result classifying finite-dimensional irreducible representations of semisimple Lie algebras. For $\mathfrak{g}_2$, it establishes a bijection between irreps and dominant integral weights.

### Key Definitions
1.  **Weight**: For a representation $\pi: \mathfrak{g}_2 \to \mathfrak{gl}(V)$, a weight is a linear functional $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ (dual of the Cartan subalgebra) such that the weight space $V_\lambda = \{v \in V \mid \pi(h)v = \lambda(h)v \text{ for all } h \in \mathfrak{h}\}$ is non-trivial. The dimension of $V_\lambda$ is the multiplicity of $\lambda$.
2.  **Highest Weight**: A weight $\lambda$ is highest if for every positive root $\alpha$, $\lambda + \alpha$ is not a weight of $V$. Equivalently, all positive root vectors $e_\alpha \in \mathfrak{g}_2$ annihilate the highest weight space $V_\lambda$.
3.  **Integral Weight**: A weight $\lambda$ is integral if it pairs integrally with all simple coroots: $(\lambda, \alpha_i^\vee) = 2(\lambda, \alpha_i)/(\alpha_i, \alpha_i) \in \mathbb{Z}$ for $i=1,2$.
4.  **Dominant Integral Weight**: An integral weight $\lambda$ is dominant if it pairs non-negatively with all simple coroots: $(\lambda, \alpha_i^\vee) \geq 0$ for $i=1,2$.

### Precise Classification Correspondence
For $\mathfrak{g}_2$, the Theorem of the Highest Weight states:
> There is a bijection between the set of isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ and the set of dominant integral weights of $\mathfrak{g}_2$.

Formally:
- For every dominant integral weight $\lambda$, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) finite-dimensional irreducible representation $V(\lambda)$ with highest weight $\lambda$.
- Every finite-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is isomorphic to $V(\lambda)$ for exactly one dominant integral weight $\lambda$.

### Construction of Dominant Integral Weights
Dominant integral weights are constructed using fundamental weights $\{\omega_1, \omega_2\}$, defined by the dual condition with simple coroots:
$$(\omega_i, \alpha_j^\vee) = \delta_{ij},$$
where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Explicitly:
- $\omega_1$: $(\omega_1, \alpha_1^\vee) = 1$ and $(\omega_1, \alpha_2^\vee) = 0$, so $(\omega_1, \alpha_1) = 1/3$ and $(\omega_1, \alpha_2) = 0$.
- $\omega_2$: $(\omega_2, \alpha_1^\vee) = 0$ and $(\omega_2, \alpha_2^\vee) = 1$, so $(\omega_2, \alpha_1) = 0$ and $(\omega_2, \alpha_2) = 1$.

Every dominant integral weight can be written uniquely as a non-negative integer linear combination of the fundamental weights:
$$\lambda = m_1\omega_1 + m_2\omega_2, \quad m_1, m_2 \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}.$$

The half-sum of positive roots $\rho = \omega_1 + \omega_2$ (a critical object in the Weyl dimension and character formulas) is the unique dominant integral weight such that $(\rho, \alpha_i^\vee) = 1$ for $i=1,2$.

## Part 4: The Fundamental Representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$

The fundamental representations of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ are the irreducible representations corresponding to the fundamental weights $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. They are the basic building blocks of all finite-dimensional irreducible representations, as every such representation can be generated by tensor products of the fundamental representations and subsequent decomposition into irreducibles.

### First Fundamental Representation: $V(\omega_1)$
- **Highest Weight**: $\omega_1$.
- **Dimension**: 7 (computed via the Weyl dimension formula, which evaluates to 7 for $\lambda = \omega_1$).
- **Common Name**: The 7-dimensional vector representation or imaginary octonion representation.
- **Realization**: $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is the automorphism group of the octonions (Cayley numbers), an 8-dimensional normed division algebra over $\mathbb{C}$. The purely imaginary octonions form a 7-dimensional vector space $\operatorname{Im}(\mathbb{O})$, and $\mathfrak{g}_2$ acts faithfully on $\operatorname{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ via automorphisms. This action defines the 7-dimensional fundamental representation. It is also realized as the space of vectors in the 7-dimensional Euclidean space equipped with a cross product, whose automorphism group is $\mathfrak{g}_2$.

### Second Fundamental Representation: $V(\omega_2)$
- **Highest Weight**: $\omega_2$.
- **Dimension**: 14 (equal to the dimension of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ itself).
- **Common Name**: The 14-dimensional adjoint representation.
- **Realization**: The adjoint representation is defined by the action of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ on itself via the Lie bracket: $\operatorname{ad}(x)y = [x, y]$ for $x, y \in \mathfrak{g}_2$. This representation is faithful, as $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is simple (it has no non-trivial ideals). It can also be realized as the space of 3-forms on $\operatorname{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ invariant under the octonion cross product.

1.  **Tensor Product Decomposition**: Every irreducible representation $V(m_1\omega_1 + m_2\omega_2)$ appears as a subrepresentation of the tensor product $V(\omega_1)^{\otimes m_1} \otimes V(\omega_2)^{\otimes m_2}$. For example, $V(\omega_1) \otimes V(\omega_1)$ decomposes into $V(0)$ (the trivial 1-dimensional representation) $\oplus V(2\omega_1) \oplus V(\omega_2) \oplus V(\omega_1)$, illustrating how new irreps are generated.
2.  **Polynomial Ring of Characters**: The ring of characters of $\mathfrak{g}_2$ is a polynomial ring generated by the characters of $V(\omega_1)$ and $V(\omega_2)$. This means the character of any irreducible representation can be expressed as a polynomial in the characters of the fundamental representations, enabling systematic computation of representation properties (e.g., dimensions, multiplicities).

In summary, the fundamental representations are the "atoms" of $\mathfrak{g}_2$’s representation theory: all other finite-dimensional irreducible representations are built from them through tensor product decomposition and Clebsch-Gordan reduction.
