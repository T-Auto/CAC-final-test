Let $X = \text{Spec}(k[[x,y]]/I) \subset \mathbb{A}^2$, where $I = (x^2, xy, y^2)$. Let $\mathfrak{m} = (x,y) \subset k[[x,y]]$. Set $V = \text{Hom}_k(I/\mathfrak{m}I, k)$. Then $V$ is the obstruction space for the canonical obstruction theory for the local ring of $X$ at the origin.

Consider the following special kind of extension problems. For $k=1, 2, 3, \dots$,

```
Spec(k[t]/(t^k)) → Spec(k[t]/(t^{k+1}))
       ↓                    ↓ (dashed)
       X ←------------------
```

where the unique point of $\text{Spec}(k[[t]]/(t^k))$ is mapped to the origin.

Find all the elements in $V$ that show up as obstruction classes for this special kind of extension problems.

[Remark: A priori, the obstruction classes live in $V \otimes (t^k)/(t^{k+1})$. To identify it with $V$, we need to choose a basis for the 1-dimensional vector space $(t^k)/(t^{k+1})$. Of course there is a natural choice. But you will see that the answer to this problem is indeed independent of the choice.]
